	The tools range from window managers, toolkits, and widget sets to

	However, only a small number of the tools attempt to incorporate
	principles of good design. They offer no help with decisions regarding
	the variety of input devices and methods available. The authors briefly
	describe a methodology for interaction technique selection based
	on natural physical analogs of the application tasks. Special emphasis
	is given to the physical characteristics of input devices and the
	pragmatics of their use. The methodology is incorporated in a software
	environment named Toto which includes knowledge acquired from a variety
	of disciplines such as: semiotics, ergonomics, and industrial design.
	Toto also incorporates a set of interactive tools for modifying the
	knowledge and for supporting the selection of natural interaction
	techniques. A two phased design process (matching followed by sequencing)
	is embedded in the Toto rule base. Examples of the use of Toto tools
	are provided to illustrate the design process. (17 Refs.)},

  abstract = {Recently a number of projects have addressed the problem of automatically
	producing interface designs for computer applications. The core of
	each of these design tools takes as input a specification of the
	functionality and information that the application is to present
	to the user and produces as output an interface specified in terms
	of some toolkit of interface techniques. Although there are a number
	of sets of guidelines for effective interface designs, they are all
	inadequate for a completely automated interface design system. The
	most obvious inadequacy is in the area of aesthetic decisions; most
	sets of interface guidelines either lack guidelines for determining
	the specific visual appearances and organization of an interface,
	or else such guidelines are too vague to be used automatically. Decisions
	about what aspects of the application to emphasize and what aspects
	to obscure are also poorly specified. Such decisions are implicit
	in any interface design, but guidelines for making them are vague
	at best, and often absent altogether. The MAID system addresses some
	of these inadequacies by using knowledge-based descriptions of real-world
	objects to guide decisions that are underspecified by a given set
	of design guidelines. (22 Refs.)},

	inheritance to reduce the effort required to specify these properties.
	It complements recent work done in programming languages, databases,

	design of a limited set of `standard' interface types, and are intended
	for expert users. The authors QUICK system explores opposite pole.
	QUICK is a toolkit for the design of highly interactive direct manipulation
	interfaces oriented specifically towards non-programmers. The challenge
	faced in QUICK lies in maximizing power and flexibility in an extremely
	simple environment. The authors explore the utility of direct manipulation,
	the object oriented paradigm and a structure editor in this context.

  abstract = {n-Vision is a testbed for exploring n-dimensional worlds containing
	functions of an arbitrary number of variables. Although their interaction
	devices and display hardware are inherently $3$D, the authors demonstrate
	how they can be used to support interaction with these higher-dimensional
	objects. They introduce a new interaction metaphor developed for
	the system, which they call `worlds within worlds': nested heterogeneous
	coordinate systems that allow the user to view and manipulate functions.
	Objects in their world may be explored with a set of tools. They
	describe an example n-Vision application in `financial visualization,'
	where the functions are models of financial instruments. n-Vision's
	software architecture supports a hierarchy of arbitrarily transformed,
	nested boxes that defines an interactive space within which information
	is displayed and input obtained. The design, modeled in part after
	the hierarchical $2$D windows of the X Window System, is intended
	to provide an environment that is well suited to the use of true
	$3$D input and stereo display devices. Boxes are associated with
	event handlers that support $3$D motion, enter, and leave events,
	and provide recognition of finger gestures. (23 Refs.)},

	input model which is designed to support a wider range of interaction
	techniques than conventional user interface toolKits. In particular
	the system supports the implementation of interaction objects using
	dragging, snapping (or gravity fields), and gesture (or handwriting)
	inputs. Because these techniques are supported directly by the toolkit
	it is also possible to create interactions that mix these techniques
	within a single interface or even a single interactor object. (26

	and inter-machine communication and persistent storage. Choices made
	in the provision of these services can impact the user interface,

  abstract = {Software engineers use graphs to represent many types of information.
	This paper describes a tool which is used to rapidly extend base
	classes to create graph editors as a user-interface to these information
	domains. This paper also presents requirements for extensible graph
	editors. These requirements establish a basis of comparison for extensible
	graph editors. An object-oriented programming language and an object-oriented
	user interface toolkit provide a great degree of flexibility for
	creating graph editors. Users create instances of a graph editor
	by specifying global and local functionality. Global functionality
	takes the form of graph layout algorithms, user interaction, and
	interaction with other tools. Local functionality is the description
	of the meaning and pictorial representation of nodes and arcs. As
	such, this paper describes a number of example graph editors that
	have been developed with these mechanisms which satisfy the requirements.

	process. Useful and reusable knowledge about the organization of
	menus and dialog boxes is identified and encapsulated in the form
	of design rules. The basic approach the authors take is embedding
	a top-down design methodology in a tool that assists designers in
	organizing the information, selecting appropriate interface object
	classes and their attributes, and placing selected interface objects
	in a dialog box or a menu in a meaningful, logical, and consistent
	manner. They let the designer specify the conceptual design of an
	application, maintain high-level style preference profiles, customize
	the appearances of interface object classes which make up an interface
	presentation, and control the priority of organization rules. The
	tool then automatically generates the user interface presentation.

  abstract = {Physical controls for most devices are either `one size fits all'
	or require custom hardware for each user. Cost often prohibits custom
	design, and each user must adapt to the standard device interface,
	typically with a loss of precision and efficiency When user abilities
	vary widely, such as in the disabled community, devices often become
	unusable. The authors create a system that tracks user gestures and
	interprets them as control signals for devices. Existing gesture
	recognition research converts continuous body motion into discrete
	symbols. The authors approach is to map continuous motions into a
	set of analog device control signals. Their system allows them to
	quickly tailor a device interface to each user's best physical range
	of motion. Their first application domain is a speech synthesizer
	for disabled users. They expect two major areas of applicability
	for non-disabled users: in telemanipulator interfaces, and as a design
	tool for creating biomechanically efficient interfaces. (41 Refs.)},

	The token language controls interaction and visual style. High level
	objects can be created from primitive objects using token templates.
	The user interface and application are controlled by token streams
	that are emitted in response to user actions. VUIMS supports a variety
	of presentation and interaction styles through simple, robust manipulation
	of a hierarchy of visual panels with a rich set of relationships
	and constraints. VUIMS has been used to implement two commercial

	a framework to utilize one knowledge model to automatically generate

	interfaces are constructed by recursively applying templates, thus
	constructing a tree of widgets to display a complex application object.
	The template-based method is more general than the interactive, WYSIWYG
	interface builders in that it can specify dynamic displays for application
	data that changes at run time. The template-based method also leads
	to more consistent, extendable and modifiable interfaces. (15 Refs.)},

	two-dimensional implicit equations and inequalities. A clear standard
	for interpreting the graphs generated by two-dimensional graphing
	software is introduced and used to evaluate the presented algorithms.
	The first approach presented uses a standard interval arithmetic
	library. This approach is shown to be faulty; an analysis of the
	failure reveals a limitation of standard interval arithmetic. Subsequent
	algorithms are developed in parallel with improvements and extensions
	to the interval arithmetic used by the graphing algorithms. Graphs
	exhibiting a variety of mathematical and artistic phenomena are shown
	to be graphed correctly by the presented algorithms. A brief comparison
	of the final algorithm presented to other graphing algorithms is

  abstract = {Historically, two types of layered architectures have been developed
	in attempts to provide the required flexibility in applications:
	user interface management systems (UIMS) and toolkits UIMS separate
	the application and its interface. Back end computations are separated
	from dialog control and style. Style, however, is often treated in
	a single interface layer. Toolkits separate style from the application.
	Dialog control remains in the back end while the implementation of
	interaction techniques is hidden in a code library. ITS is a four
	layer architecture with separate tools for back end computation,
	dialog control, rule-based interface style, and the implementation
	of graphic primitives used in the style. Recent work has focused
	particularly on the rule layer. The authors begin by reviewing previous
	work in UIMS and toolkits. Then they show how the rule layer in ITS
	combines the benefits of both UIMS and toolkits. (22 Refs.)},

	input expressions, the operands of which are themselves tools, the
	definition of which may be nested inside this tool. Input expressions
	are written much like production rules in phrase structure grammars.
	Determining whether a tool is `satisfied' can be done most advantageously
	by an input expression parser. Tool definitions may occur in-line
	or stored in a library. They are activated by a `create' primitive,
	which creates an instance of the tool and causes the input expression
	to be made active. Using this approach to higher-level input primitives,
	a programmer does not have to think about graphics input in terms
	of awaiting events, interrupts and the like.},

	for antialiasing in ray tracing is presented which utilizes cones

	point sampling, and therefore allow for more natural images. The
	mathematics involved seem only ``pretty'' for spherical objects,
	so an acid test has yet to be performed. \\ A new approach to ray
	tracing is introduced. The definition of a ``ray'' is extended into
	a cone by including information on the spread angle and the virtual
	origin. The advantages of this approach, which tries to model light
	propagation with more fidelity, include a better method of antialiasing,
	a way of calculating fuzzy shadows and dull reflections, a method
	of calculating the correct level of detail in a procedural model
	and texture map, and finally, a procedure for faster intersection
	calculation.},

  abstract = {The irradiance at a point on a surface due to a polyhedral source
	of uniform brightness is given by a well-known analytic formula.
	In this paper we derive the corresponding analytic expression for
	the {\em irradiance Jacobian\/}, the derivative of the vector representation
	of irradiance. Although the result is elementary for unoccluded sources,
	within penumbrae the irradiance Jacobian must incorporate more information
	about blockers than either the irradiance or vector irradiance. The
	expression presented here holds for any number of polyhedral blockers
	and requires only a minor extension of standard polygon clipping
	to evaluate. To illustrate its use, three related applications are
	briefing described: direct computation of isolux contours, finding
	local irradiance extrema, and iso-meshing. Isolux contours are curves
	of constant irradiance across a surface that can be followed using
	a predictor-corrector method based on the irradiance Jacobian. Similarly,
	local extrema can be found using a descent method. Finally, iso-meshing
	is a new approach to surface mesh generation that incorporates families
	of isolux contours.},

	classified into unique hypercubes and checked for intersection with
	the associated candidate object set. We compare several techniques
	for object extent testing, including boxes, spheres, plane-sets,
	and convex poyhedra. In addition, we examine optimizations made possible
	by the directional nature of the algorithm, such as sorting, caching
	and backface culling. Results indicate that this algorithm significantly

	functions, and emission functions, all of which may be perturbed
	by errors in measurement or simulation, or by simplifications made
	for computational efficiency. Discretization error is introduced
	by replacing the continuous radiative transfer equation with a finite-dimensional
	linear system, usually by means of boundary elements and a corresponding
	projection method. Finally, computational errors perturb the finite-dimensional
	linear system through imprecise form factors, inner products, visibility,
	etc., as well as by halting iterative solvers after a finite number
	of steps. Using the error taxonomy introduced in the paper we examine
	existing global illumination algorithms and suggest new avenues of

  abstract = {In Augmented Reality, see-through HMDs superimpose virtual $3$D objects
	on the real world. This technology has the potential to enhance a
	user's perception and interaction with the real world. However, many
	Augmented Reality applications will not be accepted until we can
	accurately register virtual objects with their real counterparts.
	In previous systems, such registration was achieved only from a limited
	range of viewpoints, when the user kept his head still. This paper
	offers improved registration in two areas. First, our system demonstrates
	accurate static registration across a wide variety of viewing angles
	and positions. An optoelectronic tracker provides the required range
	and accuracy. Three calibration steps determine the viewing parameters.
	Second, dynamic errors that occur when the user moves his head are
	reduced by predicting future head locations. Inertial sensors mounted
	on the HMD aid head-motion prediction. Accurate determination of
	prediction distances requires low-overhead operating systems and
	eliminating unpredictable sources of latency. On average, prediction
	with inertial sensors produces errors 2-3 times lower than prediction
	without inertial sensors and 5-10 times lower than using no prediction
	at all. Future steps that may further improve registration are outlined.},

  annote = {A collection of new methods for ray tracing differentiable surfaces
	is developed. The methods are general, and extend the set of ``ray-traceable''
	surfaces suitable for use in geometric modeling. We intersect a ray
	\underline{$l$} = \underline{$a$}$t$ + \underline{$b$}, $t > 0$ with
	a parametric surface \underline{$x$} = \underline{$f$}$(u,v)$, and
	with implicit surfaces $f(x,y,z) = 0$. A smooth surface is treated
	as a deformation of a flat sheet; the intersection problem is converted
	to a new coordinate system in which the surfaces are flat, and the
	rays are bent. We develop methods for providing good initial estimates
	of the parametric intersection values, and a ``closeness criterion,''
	to reduce computation. These same criteria help substitute a set
	of simpler surfaces for the more complex surface. The parametric
	method produces the intersection values of $u, v,$ and $t$. These
	are suitable for shading calculations and for mapping textures onto
	the surface; they can also produce the local coordinate frame values,
	suitable for anisotropic lighting models.},

	is user-intensive and requires significant knowledge of the method.
	As a result, few end-users such as architects and designers use it.
	The output of most commercial modeling packages must be substantially
	``cleaned-up'' to satisfy the geometrical and topological criteria
	imposed by radiosity solution algorithms. Furthermore, the mesh used
	as the basis of the radiosity computation must meet several additional
	requirements for the solution to be accurate. \\ A set of geometrical
	and topological requirements is formalized that when satisfied yields
	an accurate radiosity solution. A series of algorithms is introduced
	that automatically processes raw model databases to meet these requirements.
	Thus, the end-user can concentrate on the design rather than on the
	details of the radiosity solution process. These algorithms are generally
	independent of the radiosity solution technique used, and thus apply
	to all mesh based radiosity methods.},

  abstract = {The use of double-buffered displays, in which the previous image is
	displayed until the next image is complete, can impair the interactivity
	of systems that require tight coupling between the human user and
	the computer. We are experimenting with an alternate rendering strategy
	that computes each pixel based on the most recent input (i.e., view
	and object positions) and immediately updates the pixel on the display.
	We avoid the image tearing normally associated with single-buffered
	displays by randomizing the order in which pixels are updated. The
	resulting image sequences give the impression of moving continuously,
	with a rough approximation of motion blur, rather than jerking between
	discrete positions. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this
	{\em frameless rendering\/} method with a simulation that shows conventional
	double-buffering side-by-side with frameless rendering. Both methods
	are allowed the same computation budget, but the double-buffered
	display only updates after all pixels are computed while the frameless
	rendering display updates pixels as they are computed. The frameless
	rendering display exhibits fluid motion while the double-buffered
	display jumps from frame to frame. The randomized sampling inherent
	in frameless rendering means that we cannot take advantage of image
	and object coherence properties that are important to current polygon
	renderers, but for renderers based on tracing independent rays the
	added cost is small.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in video-tracking allow the outlines of moving,
	natural objects in a video-camera input stream to be tracked live,
	at full video-rate. Previous systems have been available to do this
	for specially illuminated objects or for naturally illuminated but
	polyhedral objects. Other systems have been able to track nonpolyhedral
	objects in motion, in some cases from live video, but following only
	centroids or key-points rather than tracking whole curves. The system
	described here can track accurately the curved silhouettes of moving
	non-polyhedral objects at frame-rate, for example hands, lips, legs,
	vehicles, fruit, and without any special hardware beyond a desktop
	workstation and a video-camera and framestore. The new algorithms
	are a synthesis of methods in deformable models, B-splines curve
	representation and control theory. This paper shows how such a facility
	can be used to turn parts of the body---for instance, hands and lips---into
	input devices. Rigid motion of a hand can be used as a $3$D mouse
	with non-rigid gestures signalling a button press or the ``lifting''
	of the mouse. Both rigid and non-rigid motions of lips can be tracked
	independently and used as inputs, for example to animate a computer-generated
	face.},

	lies within the boundaries of the display screen. Homogeneous coordinates
	are a convenient mathematical device for representing and transforming
	objects. The space represented by homogeneous coordinates is not,
	however, a simple Euclidean 3-space. It is, in fact, analogous to
	a topological shape called a ``projective plane''. The clipping problem
	is usually solved without consideration for the differences between
	Euclidean space and the space represented by homogeneous coordinates.
	For some constructions, this leads to errors in picture generation
	which show up as lines marked invisible when they should be visible.
	This study examines these cases and presents techniques for correctly
	clipping the line segments.},

  annote = {The complexity of computer graphics illumination models and the associated
	need to find ways of reducing evaluation time has led to the use
	of two methods for simplifying the spectral data needed for an exact
	solution. The first method, where spectral data is sampled at a number
	of discrete points, has been intensively investigated and bounds
	for the error are known. Unfortunately, the second method, where
	spectral data is replaced with tristimulus values (such as RGB values),
	is very little understood even though it is widely used. In this
	paper we examine the error incurred by the use of this method by
	investigating the problem of approximating the tristimulus coordinated
	of light reflected from a surface from those of the source and the
	surface. A variation on a well known and widely used approximation
	is presented. This variation uses the XYZ primaries which have unique
	properties that yield straightforward analytical bounds for the approximation
	error. This analysis is important because it gives a sound mathematical
	footing to the widely used method of trichromatic approximation.
	The error bounds will give some insights into the factors that affect
	accuracy and will indicate why this method often works quite well
	in practice.},

	much easier for the user to control if the subimage moves the same
	direction as his hand while he manipulates the control device. The
	implementation of such coordinated motion of hand and subimage implies
	modification of the normal procedure for calculating transformations.
	The convenience of such manipulation also depends on appropriate
	selection or design of the input device. A review is presented of
	the relevant attributes of locator devices and presents an approach
	to selection. It presents the mathematics of transformation nesting
	and ``compensation'' to preserve motion-synchrony. Finally, it offers
	a case history of an interactive graphic system whose human factors
	were improved by these techniques.},

	Some interesting results on $3$D/6D manipulation: * Users of an imperfect-perception
	visual system tend to decompose three-dimensional positioning tasks
	into several separate subtasks, each of lower dimensionality * Even
	in real space, subjects usually decompose 6D docking tasks into $3$D
	positionings alternating with $3$D rotations. More than $2$D motions
	are rarely observed in virtual space.},

  abstract = {A good discussion of the issues involved in touch-sensitive input
	devices. The technology level described in the paper has probably
	advanced considerably since 1985, though. Main advantages noted:
	* No mechanical intermediate device (direct hand contact) * the tracking
	symbol ``stays put'' once placed --- you don't have to worry about
	``bumping the mouse'' * No mechanical / kinesthetic restrictions
	on the ability to indicate more than one point at once. * Low profile,
	allowing easy integration into desktops / other equipment * one piece
	construction --- dirt doesn't get in the cracks * no moving parts
	--- reliable Perhaps the biggest combined plus is that they can save
	screen real estate, and in combination with a physical template,
	can be operated by the user while attention is focused on the screen.
	One general comment is that it is preferable to implement valuators
	that sense *change* in position as opposed to *absolute* position.
	The chief difficulty is probably that there is no direct physical
	or visual feedback (e.g., when positioning a valuator) provided by
	the tablet surface.},

	these symptoms is to filter the image before sampling at the display
	resolution. One filter that works quite effectively is equivalent
	to integrating the visible intensities over the area that the pixel
	covers. A correct solution for this filter requires a hidden-surface
	algorithm at each pixel! If the data at the pixel is presented as
	a depth-ordered list of polygons then the average visible intensity
	can be found using a polygon clipper in a way similar to that employed
	by two known hidden-surface algorithms. All of the polygons in a
	pixel are clipped against some front unclipped edge into two lists
	of polygons.},

	vertical/horizontal mouse movement to control x and y rotations,
	while circular movement means z rotation. 3. Continuous XY + Z: 4.
	Virtual Sphere: Chen's user study indicated that the Virtual Sphere
	technique achieved the best results. He also compared the Virtual
	Sphere with a similar technique developed by Evans et al. [Evans
	81]; no significant difference was found in mean time to complete
	simple or complex rotations, but users preferred the Virtual Sphere

  annote = {A new progressive global illumination method is presented which produces
	approximate images quickly, and then continues to systematically
	produce more accurate images. The method combines the existing methods
	of progressive refinement radiosity, Monte Carlo path tracing and
	light ray tracing. The method does not place any limitation on surface
	properties such as ideal Lambertian or mirror-like. To increase efficiency
	and accuracy, the new concepts of light source reclassification,
	caustics reconstruction, Monte Carlo path tracing with a radiosity
	preprocess and an interruptible radiosity solution are introduced.
	The method presents the user with most useful information about the
	scene as early a possible by reorganizing the method into a radiosity
	pass, a high frequency refinement pass and a low frequency refinement
	pass. The implementation of the method is demonstrated, and sample
	images are presented.},

	limitations, connecting nodes of one contour to their nearest neighbors
	in the other contour. While the mapping procedure provides a basis
	for branching decisions, highly ambiguous situations are resolved
	by user interaction. The program was designed to interface a contour
	definition of the components of a human brain. These brain data are
	a most complex definition and, as such, serve to illustrate both

	techniques in computer graphics. Many phenomena that are difficult
	or impossible with other techniques are simple with ray tracing,
	including shadows, reflections, and refracted light. Ray directions,
	however, have been determined precisely, and this has limited the
	capabilities of ray tracing. By distributing the directions of the
	rays according to the analytic function they sample, ray tracing
	can incorporate fuzzy phenomena. This provides correct and easy solutions
	to some previously unsolved or partially solved problems, including
	motion blur, depth of field, penumbras, translucency, and fuzzy reflections.
	Motion blur and depth of field calculations can be integrated with
	the visible surface calculations, avoiding the problems found in
	previous methods.},

  abstract = {Medical imaging has given radiologists an ability that photography
	was not able to provide: it lets them see inside the human body.
	With the advent of 3D visualization systems, these images can be
	put together into crisp and impressive renderings of the human body
	from a variety of perspectives that were only dreamt of before, revolutionizing
	clinical practice.\par
	
	 Light transport models soon emerged to allow light interactions that,
	although not realistic in the physical sense, proved to be more effective
	for understanding the complex relationships among the anatomical
	structures. For instance, bone could be made semi-transparent to
	provide visibility of brain tissue. Skin could be removed altogether
	from an image to show only muscle or internal organs. However, soon
	it became evident that simply rendering these images in their raw
	form was no longer effective and the clear visualization of internal
	structures remains elusive.\par
	
	 The depiction of internal parts in the context of the enclosing space
	is a difficult problem that has occupied the mind of artists, illustrators
	and visualization practitioners. Despite the advances made in computer
	graphics for simulating the light transport in semi-transparent media,
	the problem of visualizing internal objects is no longer a rendering
	problem, but that of classification. Medical imaging technology obtains
	representations of anatomical structures via indirect ways, such
	as the response of tissue to X-rays or the alignment of electrons
	in a magnetic field. Therefore, the absence of semantic information
	prevents visualization practitioners from clearly marking up the
	regions that must be visualized. Without access to those regions,
	exploration becomes tedious and time-consuming. The predominant approach
	has been the use of transfer functions, or opacity mappings, which
	assign transparency properties to different intervals in the data.
	This method, however, does not guarantee that internal structures
	are visible. Other strategies must be used. In this article, I describe
	some visualization techniques that have emerged to obtain clear views
	of internal features in 3D volume data.},

  abstract = {One of the major problems facing educators who teach computer animation
	is how to balance the technical and conceptual skills required to
	produce effective computer animation in a manner that is holistic.
	Often a single class cannot deal with both the conceptual and technical
	issues involved. When courses are offered separately, often students
	don't make the connections between them. By threading the course
	objectives across multiple classes, students are exposed to the {\em
	connections\/} between concepts and technology, and are challenged
	to build their own 'conceptual bridges' to integrate ideas and techniques.
	This article addresses issues specific to teaching computer animation:
	how do you introduce students to all of the technical and conceptual
	aspects of animation in a way that will empower them to produce meaningful
	work?The Computer Animation Department at Ringling School of Art
	and Design has three required courses for the major in the fall semester
	of the sophomore year. These courses serve as an introduction to
	animation techniques and processes which students use throughout
	the curriculum. The courses are Computer Animation I, Concept Development
	I and Traditional Animation I. For the past two years, the faculty
	has been working on threading the course objectives in order to make
	students aware of the concepts and principles that are interwoven
	throughout the computer animation curriculum. This 'threaded curriculum'
	is a work in progress. Our initial goals are to define the groupings
	of course objectives that the classes have in common, and to begin
	to track the connections. As we continue to refine the process, we
	are seeing more ways in which the connections can be made deeper,
	and we have also identified problem areas where the threading does
	not seem to be as complete.},

  abstract = {Ecological research is changing as scientists confront the complexities
	of natural and human-influenced ecosystems. Early ecological research
	was dominated by the concepts of equilibrium and determinism [30].
	Ecosystems were thought to be stable 'super-organisms,' fine-tuned
	by thousands of years of mutual adaptation. In such a world, ecosystems
	can be completely described with static measures of equilibrium population
	densities. Although this view has been challenged since its inception,
	it is only in the past 25 years that it has been displaced as the
	dominant paradigm in ecology. Today, ecologists describe ecosystems
	as a dynamic collection of individuals responding in different ways
	to local interactions, broad-scale environmental change and frequent
	accidents of history [18, 23, 30]. Although the behavior of the ecosystem
	is partially understandable from population densities, ecosystem
	dynamics are variable and complex. Ecologists use an increasingly
	sophisticated toolbox of techniques to characterize these complex
	dynamics. Field surveys and laboratory experiments measure the responses
	of individuals under varied conditions. Thus the mean response as
	well as the variance in response can be estimated. Improved statistical
	analyses allow ecologists to describe spatial structure, temporal
	dynamics and complex spatio-temporal patterns. Finally, mathematical
	models are being developed that can simulate the complex local interactions
	of thousands of individuals in a dynamic, heterogeneous environment
	[9, 17, 34].Improvements in computer hardware and software have facilitated
	this shift toward increasing complexity. Today, ecologists are seldom
	limited by hardware, and software to acquire, store and analyze data
	has improved dramatically in the past decade. In addition, computational
	models of ecological systems are becoming common [14]. Models are
	tools to express our understanding of mechanisms governing the structure
	and function of ecological communities [20]. Models can also be used
	to make predictions, determine the robustness of these predictions,
	reveal system properties and highlight weaknesses in our knowledge
	[8, 25]. Complex ecological models have several important drawbacks
	including the need for huge amounts of input data, propagation of
	errors and difficulty interpreting the often voluminous model output
	[10, 11, 13]. As a result, increased model complexity and detail
	may not lead to increased understanding [10, 16, 22].},

	An algorithm and architecture that allows dynamic load balancing

	into blocks and assign processors to these blocks. They use message
	passing between processors to move boundaries when a processor is
	overloaded. An interesting feature is that when the system is overloaded,
	rays get dropped, so image quality is reduced. The system has some
	fault tolerance built in. \\ An algorithm for computing ray traced
	pictures is presented, which adaptively subdivides scenes into $S$
	subregions, each with roughly uniform load. It can yield speedups
	of $O(S^{2/3})$ over the standard algorithm. \\ This algorithm can
	be mapped onto a parallel architecture consisting of a three dimensional
	array of computers which operate autonomously. The algorithm and
	architecture are well matched, so that communication overhead is
	small with respect to the computation, for sufficiently complex scenes.
	This allows close to linear improvements in performance, even with
	thousands of computers, in addition to the improvement due to subdivision.
	\\ The algorithm and architecture provide mechanisms to gracefully
	degrade in response to excessive load. The architecture also tolerates

	is necessary for realistic rendering and for discontinuity meshing
	for global illumination. A new shadow-determination algorithm is
	presented that uses a data structure, called a {\em backprojection\/},
	to represent the visible portion of a light source from any point
	in the scene. A complete discontinuity meshing algorithm is described
	for polyhedral scenes and area light sources, which includes an important
	class of light/geometry interactions that have not been implemented
	before. A fast incremental algorithm for computing backprojections
	is also described. The use of spatial subdivision, and heuristics
	based on computed statistics of typical scenes, results in efficient
	mesh and backprojection computation. Results of the implementation
	show that the use of the backprojection and discontinuity meshing
	permits accelerated high-quality rendering of shadows using both
	ray-casting and polygon-rendering with interpolants.},

	difficulties in motivating students to develop a visual literacy
	in computer graphics. Although a highly prized skill in industry,
	visual literacy is intimidating to computer science students because
	they are uneasy about using their eyes to examine computer-synthesized
	images. Even though they are used to using their eyes for acquiring
	information, the topics of analysis and interpretation intimidate
	art students. Further, art students may not have as much background
	to understand the technical terminology. This first column in a two-part
	series discusses an interdisciplinary approach for teaching visual
	literacy that overcomes these obstacles. With this approach students
	become more familiar with the limits and possibilities of the medium
	of computer graphics, learn how to analyze and talk about what visual
	images might mean and develop a deeper understanding of time constraints.
	In addition, they gain confidence with technological terminology
	and the idea of suggesting alternative algorithms to create a desired
	visual 'look.' As a result, both computer science and art students
	become more able to communicate effectively about and with visual
	imagery.},

  abstract = {An efficient algorithm for displaying 3-D scenes showing a discrete
	spatially varying surface is described. Given a 2-D map or planar
	graph composed of polygons where each polygon has a positive real
	number attribute, a prism is erected on each polygon with height
	proportional to that attribute. The resulting 3-D scene is plotted
	with shading and hidden lines removed. Thus the spatial variation
	of the attribute may be quickly and intuitively grasped by the nontechnical
	observer. This has applications to areas such as geography if the
	map is a cartographic map, or to physics if the map diagrams the
	periodic table. The algorithm takes time O(N*log(N)) where N is the
	number of edges in the map. Most of the calculations can be done
	without knowing the prism heights so extra plots with different attributes
	for the prisms can be produced quickly. This algorithm has been implemented
	and tested on maps of up to 12000 edges.},

	object descriptions from high-level specifications. The technique
	includes mechanisms for describing, selecting, and combining primitive
	elements of object descriptions. Underlying these mechanisms are
	a referential framework for describing information used in the construction
	of object descriptions and a computational model of the object-synthesis
	process. This technique has been implemented in two prototype systems
	to synthesize object descriptions in near-real time. One system creates
	graphical displays of information that resides in a conventional
	database. The other system is a computer graphicist's tool for creating
	backgrounds of complex, three-dimensional scenes.},

  abstract = {We begin by reviewing spatial data management - technique of accessing
	and organizing information via its graphical representation in an
	organized spatial framework. We describe an operational prototype
	system that exceeds the capabilities of other spatial data management
	systems in two ways: (1) the graphical presentation of data is tailored
	to the user's identity, task, and database query; and (2) the system
	has the capacity for large databases. These capabilities are possible
	because the system dynamically generates its graphics environment.
	Our technique for dynamically generating the graphics environment
	relies on modeling of user context, semantic modeling of the underlying
	database, and direct use of knowledge about design layout and the
	utility of pictures. We briefly describe our current research efforts
	to extend this knowledge-based approach to automatic graphics environment
	synthesis.},
  annote = {The system is composed of two main modules: an answer space generator,
	which combines the user's query specification with knowledge about
	the user's viewing preferences, task goals, and other information
	gathered throughtout the query session, outputting a description
	of the answer space as it should be presented to the I space that
	is the system's graphical response to the user's database query.
	The system uses a joystick, a dater tablet, a keyboard, and two touch-sensitive
	color displays as input devices to specify a query. Icons are selected
	by a complex heiristic algorithm, taking into account the user's
	identity, task, the particular entity type, and attribute list (attribute
	values are not involved). Icons are placed on a rectangular grid,
	scaled based on space constraints. Additional icons are available
	if the user moves to a portion of the image space not displayed with
	detail monitor (there are two levels displayed, the entire space
	and a more detailed view, on separate monitors).},

	A texture pattern is composed of fixed-sized windows as subpatterns.

	the gray level of each pixel. A tree grammar is then used to characterize
	the windowed texture pattern. Distortion or noise in the texture
	pattern can be considered by using stochastic tree grammars. A procedure

  abstract = {In this paper we discuss the efficient and accurate incorporation
	of texture maps into a hierarchical Galerkin radiosity algorithm.
	This extension of the standard algorithm allows the use of textures
	to describe complex reflectance and emittance patterns over surfaces,
	increasing the realism and complexity of radiosity images. Previous
	approaches to the inclusion of textures have either averaged the
	texture to yield a single color for the radiosity computations, or
	exhaustively generated detail elements---possibly as many as one
	per texture pixel. The former does not capture important lighting
	effects due to textures, while the latter is too expensive computationally
	to be practical. To handle texture maps requires a detailed analysis
	of the underlying operator equation. In particular we decompose the
	radiosity equation into two steps: (i) the computation of irradiance
	on a surface from the radiosities on other surfaces, and (ii) the
	application of the reflectance operator [rho] to compute radiosities
	from irradiances. We then describe an algorithm that maintains hierarchical
	representations of both radiosities and textures. The numerical error
	involved in using these approximations is quantifiable and a time/error
	tradeoff is possible. The resulting algorithm allows texture maps
	to be used in radiosity computations with very little overhead.},

  abstract = {In previous work, we presented an algorithm to accelerate z-buffer
	rendering of enormously complex scenes. Here, we extend the approach
	to antialiased rendering with an algorithm that guarantees that each
	pixel of the output image is within a user-specified error tolerance
	of the filtered underlying continuous image. As before, we use an
	object-space octree to cull hidden geometry rapidly. However, instead
	of using an image-space depth pyramid to test visibility of collections
	of pixel samples, we use a quadtree data structure to test visibility
	throughout image-space regions. When regions are too complex, we
	use quadtree subdivision to simplify the geometry as in Warnock's
	algorithm. Subdivison stops when the algorithm can either analytically
	filter the required region or bound the convolution integral appropriately
	with interval methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
	first algorithm to antialias with guaranteed accuracy scenes consisting
	of hundreds of millions of polygons.},

	of modern finite element programs. A method is described which utilizes
	interactive computer graphics digitizing techniques to create a powerful
	input preprocessor for finite element analysis. A limited number
	of general mesh generators based on linear blending functions permit
	the program to handle virtually all two-dimensional topologies. The
	processes of geometric input and specification of problem-specific
	``attributes'' have been kept separate so that the mesh generation
	routines may be used with a variety of analysis programs. Graphical
	editors have been implemented to specify attributes for structural
	mechanics problems. Although this type of graphical preprocessor
	shows considerable promise for applications in three dimensions,
	there are still unresolved problems in the areas of geometrical description,
	perception, and interactive hardware.},

  annote = {This paper presents a rapid hierarchical radiosity algorithm for
	illuminating scenes containing large polygonal patches. The algorithm
	constructs a hierarchical representation of the form factor matrix
	by adaptively subdividing patches into subpatches according to a
	user-supplied error bound. The algorithm guarantees that all form
	factors are calculated to the same precision, removing many common
	image artifacts due to in accurate form factors. More importantly,
	the algorithm decomposes the form factor matrix into at most O(n)
	blocks (where n is the number of elements). Previous radiosity algorithms
	represented the element-to-element transport interactions with n2
	form factors. Visibility algorithms are given that work well with
	this approach. Standard techniques for shooting and gathering can
	be used with the hierarchical representation to solve for equilibrium
	radiosities, but we also discuss using a brightness-weighted error
	criteria, in conjunction with multigridding, to even more rapidly
	progressively refine the image.},

  annote = {Weiler-Atherton algorithm applied to ray tracing. Heckbert and Hanrahan
	present an elegant image space algorithm for rendering objects composed
	of polygonal facets. It utilizes image coherence and generates a
	final picture consisting of polygons. \\ Ray tracing has produced
	some of the most realistic computer generated pictures to date. They
	contain surface texturing, local shading, shadows, reflections, and
	refractions. The major disadvantage of ray tracing results from its
	point-sampling approach. Because calculation proceeds {\em ab initio}
	at each pixel it is very CPU intensive and may contain noticeable
	aliasing artifacts. It is difficult to take advantage of spatial
	coherence because the shapes of reflections and refractions from
	curved surfaces are so complex. \\ In this paper we describe an algorithm
	that utilizes the spatial coherence of polygonal environments by
	combining features of both image and object space hidden surface
	algorithms. Instead of tracing infinitesimally thin rays of light,
	we sweep areas through a scene to form ``beams.'' This technique
	works particularly well for polygonal models since for this case
	the reflections are linear transformation, and refractions are often
	approximately so. \\ The recursive beam tracer begins by sweeping
	the projection plane through the scene. Beam-surface intersections
	are computed using two-dimensional polygonal set operations and an
	occlusion algorithm similar to the Weiler-Atherton hidden surface
	algorithm. For each beam-polygon intersection the beam is fragmented
	and new beams created for the reflected and transmitted swath of
	light. These sub-beams are redirected with a 4x4 matrix transformation
	and recursively traced. This beam tree is an object space representation
	of the entire picture.},

  abstract = {TIGS is a general purpose subroutine package providing display generation
	and interaction capability for a general class of graphics terminals.
	The package is computer, operating system, and display device independent.
	Primary design objectives were transportability, maintainability,
	and ease of use. Features supported by TIGS include line, arc, multi-line
	plot, test and dot primitives with resettable attributes such as
	line style, character size, intensity, font, color, transformation
	matrix, etc. The package uses virtual devices such as locators, keyboards,
	picking devices and function keys which can represent a wide range
	of physical devices. TIGS supports modelling transformations, 2D
	and 3D viewing transformations for clipping and window to viewport
	mapping. TIGS uses the interpretive approach which uses a device
	independent neutral display file. This neutral display file contains
	information describing all segments, pictures, windows, and viewports
	in a device independent manner. The file may be saved and used in
	a later job with a different display device.},

	A scientist would create a visualization using a conventional system,
	and publish it on a website - for a reader to later observe. The
	Web was simply a publication medium. Today of course the Web represents
	a rich distributed computing environment: visualization can now be
	executed as a live process with active engagement from the audience.
	A new field of Web-based visualization has emerged.},

	membranes. Constraints corresponding to the dimensions of technical
	drawings are applied to the structure, either by the designer or
	by an automatic dimensioning algorithm. The validity of the resultant
	scheme can be checked and then drawn using drawing office conventions.
	The data structure can handle dimensions fixing various types of
	curved surface; other types can easily be added by following the
	same rules. A method of changing the nominal shape of an object is
	demonstrated. These results provide a systematic account of the ill-defined
	art of dimensioning and tolerancing, and should make the draughting
	process more amenable to computation.},

	concise, piecewise smooth surface models from scattered range data.
	The method can be used in a variety of applications such as reverse
	engineering---the automatic generation of CAD models from physical
	objects. Novel aspects of the method are its ability to model surfaces
	of arbitrary topological type and to recover sharp features such
	as creases and corners. The method has proven to be effective, as
	demonstrated by a number of examples using both simulated and real
	data. A key ingredient in the method, and a principal contribution
	of this paper, is the introduction of a new class of piecewise smooth
	surface representations based on subdivision. These surfaces have
	a number of properties that make them ideal for use in surface reconstruction:
	they are simple to implement, they can model sharp features concisely,
	and they can be fit to scattered range data using an unconstrained
	optimization procedure.},

	\\ In this paper, we report a scanline based {\em REST-frame} rendering
	method that provides a faster alternative to the original ray-tracing
	based {\em REST-frame} implementation. This new method operates in
	the spirit of the classical Z-buffer in computer graphics and the
	inter-inertial frames point-mapping method investigated in physics
	in the early 1960's, and determines the visibility of points in spacetime
	by their spatial {\em and} temporal visibility. Specifically, all
	spacetime event points that are {\em potentially} visible from the
	viewpoint at the imaging time are geometrically projected in three
	dimensional ($3$D) space to the image plane pixel buffer. Multiple
	points with a same pixel affiliation are sorted by their {\em time
	distance} from the imaging time, and the most recent spacetime points
	is displayed. \\ Motion blur in real world images caused by the noRfinitesimal
	exposure time of image-taking can be simulated by {\em ``Stochastic
	T-Buffer''}, which perturbs the {\em time component} of the scan-converted
	spacetime events that are potentially visible. The classical A-Buffer
	technique that models translucency also can be adapted easily in
	T-Buffer. The limitation of T-Buffer is its inability to model specular
	reflection and refraction in optics, which our original {\em REST-frame}
	implementation simulates completely.},

  abstract = {The use of {\em skeletal strokes\/} is a new vector graphics realization
	of the brush and stroke metaphor using arbitrary pictures as ``ink''.
	It is based on an idealized $2$D deformation model defined by an
	arbitrary path. Its expressiveness as a general brush stroke replacement
	and efficiency for interactive use make it suitable as a basic drawing
	primitive in drawing programs as well as windowing and page description
	systems. This paper presents our drawing and animation system, ``Skeletal
	Draw'', based on skeletal strokes. The effectiveness of the system
	in stylish picture creation is illustrated with various pictures
	made with it. Decisions made in the handling of sub-strokes in a
	higher order stroke and recursive strokes are discussed. The general
	anchoring mechanism in the skeletal stroke framework allows any arbitrary
	picture deformation to be abstracted into a single stroke. Its extension
	to piecewise continuous anchoring and the anchoring of shear angle
	and stroke width are explained. We demonstrated how this mechanism
	allows us to build up powerful pseudo-$3$D models which are particularly
	useful in the production of 2 1/2 D cartoon drawings and animation.
	Animation sequences have been made to illustrate the ideas, including
	a vector graphics based motion blurring technique.},

	errors are measured and displayed simultaneously. Using intermediate
	error assessment results, a reduction of intersection volume algorithm
	is developed to eliminate gouges on the workpiece via tool path correction.
	Finally, the view dependency typical of previous spatial partitioning-based
	NC simulation methods is overcome by a contour display technique
	which generates parallel planar contours to represent the workpiece,
	thus enabling dynamic viewing transformations without reconstruction

	systems. By mirroring this mechanism, full-color display devices
	create colors as mixtures of three primaries. Any displayable color
	can be described by the corresponding values of these primaries.
	Frequently it is more convenient to define various other color spaces,
	or coordinate systems, for color representation or manipulation.
	Several such color spaces are presented which are suitable for applications
	involving user specification of color, along with the defining equations
	and illustrations. The use of special color spaces for particular

	Each entity on the display screen can be independently programmed

	entities. The scheme presented begins with the notion of a quantum
	of time, or tick, within which there are no ordering constraints

	next tick. Ticks are a powerful means of controlling parallel processes
	but are usually at too low a conceptual level for user convenience.
	Higher-level operations built upon the tick mechanism are presented,
	most notably the ability to instruct any entity or group of entities
	to gradually change or move at a rate that is itself changeable by
	the same operation. To illustrate these ideas a simple celestial
	mechanics simulation is presented. Upon each tick the velocities
	and positions of the objects are updated by the gravitational and

	We present new algorithms for efficient ray tracing of three procedurally
	defined objects: fractal surfaces, prisms, and surfaces of revolution.
	The fractal surface algorithm performs recursive subdivision adaptively.
	Subsurfaces which cannot intersect a given ray are culled from further
	consideration. The prism algorithm transforms the three-dimensional
	ray-surface intersection problem into a two-dimensional ray-curve
	intersection problem, which is solved by the method of strip trees.
	The surface-of-revolution algorithm transforms the three-dimensional
	ray-surface intersection problem into a two-dimensional curve-curve
	intersection problem, which again is solved by strip trees. \\ Kajiya
	presents good solid methods for ray tracing various models which
	are represented procedurally. Fractals are ray traced as they are
	built, which keeps unseen fractal surfaces from being evolved. Prisms
	are ray traced in a fairly simple fashion. A clever use of geometric
	transforms is used to ray trace surfaces of revolution. Makes good
	use of strip trees (see Ballard).},

	Graphics Processor, Control Processor, Input-Output Processor, Real-Time

  annote = {2.5-D ray tracing: refraction by warping background image, contains
	better refraction formula than Whitted Simple transparency algorithms
	which assume a linear transparency over an entire surface are the
	type most often employed to produce computer synthesized images of
	transparent objects with curved surfaces. Although most of the images
	created with these algorithms do give the impression of transparency,
	they usually do not look realistic. One of the most serious problems
	is that the intensity of the light that is transmitted through the
	objects is generally not proportional to the amount of material through
	which it must pass. Another problem is that the image seen behind
	the objects is not distorted as would naturally occur when the light
	is refracted as it passes through a material of different density.
	\\ Use of a non-linear transparency algorithm can provide a great
	improvement in the realism of an image at a small additional cost.
	Making the transparency proportional to the normal to the surface
	causes it to decrease towards the edges of the surface where the
	path of the light through the object is longer. The observer, through
	the picture plane and through each transparent object until an opaque
	surface is intersected. Since the direction of the ray would change
	as each material of differing optical density was entered, the hidden
	surface calculations required would be very time consuming. However,
	if a few assumptions are made about the geometry of each object and
	about the conditions under which they are viewed, a much simpler
	algorithm can be used to approximate the refractive effect. This
	method proceeds in a back to front order, mapping the current background
	image onto the next surface, until all surfaces have been considered.},

  annote = {We examine a class of adaptive sampling techniques employed in image
	synthesis and show that those commonly used for efficient anti-aliasing
	are statistically biased. This bias is dependent upon the image function
	being sampled as well as the strategy for determining the number
	of samples to use. It is most prominent in areas of high contrast
	and is attributable to early stages of sampling systematically favoring
	one extreme or the other. If the expected outcome of the entire adaptive
	sampling algorithm is considered, we find that the bias of the early
	decisions is still present in the final estimator. We propose an
	alternative strategy for performing adaptive sampling that is unbiased
	but potentially more costly. We conclude that it may not always be
	practical to mitigate this source of bias, but as a source of error
	it should be considered when high accuracy and image fidelity are
	a central concern.},

  abstract = {Several existing volume rendering algorithms operate by factoring
	the viewing transformation into a $3$D shear parallel to the data
	slices, a projection to form an intermediate but distorted image,
	and a $2$D warp to form an undistorted final image. We extend this
	class of algorithms in three ways. First, we describe a new object-order
	rendering algorithm based on the factorization that is significantly
	faster than published algorithms with minimal loss of image quality.
	Shear-warp factorizations have the property that rows of voxels in
	the volume are aligned with rows of pixels in the intermediate image.
	We use this fact to construct a scanline-based algorithm that traverses
	the volume and the intermediate image in synchrony, taking advantage
	of the spatial coherence present in both. We use spatial data structures
	based on run-length encoding for both the volume and the intermediate
	image. Our implementation running on an SGI Indigo workstation renders
	a 2563 voxel medical data set in one second. Our second extension
	is a shear-warp factorization for perspective viewing transformations,
	and we show how our rendering algorithm can support this extension.
	Third, we introduce a data structure for encoding spatial coherence
	in unclassified volumes (i.e. scalar fields with no precomputed opacity).
	When combined with our shear-warp rendering algorithm this data structure
	allows us to classify and render a 2563 voxel volume in three seconds.
	The method extends to support mixed volumes and geometry and is parallelizable.},

	{\em The Adventures of Andr{\'e} and Wally B.,\/} at SIGGRAPH 84,
	a number of people asked me what cool new software I had used to
	achieve such believable characters. I explained to them that the
	software was a keyframe animation system, not much different in theory
	than other systems that were around then. What was different was
	that I was using basic animation principles that I had learned as
	a traditional animator. It was not the software that gave life to
	the characters, it was these principles of animation, these tricks
	of the trade that animators had developed over 50 years ago. I was
	surprised at how few people in the computer animation community were
	aware of these principles. Traditional animation is basically one
	trick after another. Whatever it takes to get it working right on
	the screen is fair game. It should be the same in computer animation.
	At Pixar, we constantly use tricks, old and new, to get what we need
	on the screen. In this talk, I will give away a few trade secrets
	that will be useful to anyone attempting to animate characters with
	computers, regardless of the software they are using.},

	to describe a technique for using each ray of a super-sampled ray
	tracing procedure as a sample in several dimensions to achieve effects
	such as penumbras and motion blur in addition to spatial antialiasing.
	The shade to be displayed at a pixel is a weighted integral of the
	image function. The purpose of using many rays per pixel is to estimate
	the value of this integral. In this work, a relationship between
	the number of sample rays and the quality of the estimate of this
	integral is derived. Furthermore, the number of rays required does
	not depend on the dimensionality of the space being sampled, but
	only on the variance of the multi-dimensional image function. The
	algorithm has been optimized through the use of statistical testing
	and stratified sampling.},

	in our spreadsheet contain graphical objects such as images, volumes,
	or movies. Cells may also contain widgets such as buttons, sliders,
	or curve editors. Objects are displayed in miniature inside each
	cell. Formulas for cells are written in a general-purpose programming
	language (Tcl) augmented with operators for array manipulation, image
	processing, and rendering. Compared to flow chart visualization systems,
	spreadsheets are more expressive, morescalable, and easier to program.
	Compared to conventional numerical spreadsheets, spreadsheets for
	images pose several unique design problems: larger formulas, longer
	computation times, and more complicated intercelldependencies. In
	response to these problems, we have extended the spreadsheet paradigm
	in three ways: formulas can display their results anywhere in the
	spreadsheet, cells can be selectively disabled, and multiple cells
	can be edited at once. We discuss these extensions and their implications,
	and we also point out some unexpected uses for our spreadsheets:
	as a visual database browser, as a graphical user interface builder,
	as a smart clipboard for the desktop, and as a presentation tool.},

	estimates for local and total errors in radiosity solutions. The
	ability to obtain bounds and estimates for the total error is crucial
	fro reliably judging the acceptability of a solution. Realistic estimates
	of the local error improve the efficiency of adaptive radiosity algorithms,
	such as hierarchical radiosity, by indicating where adaptive refinement
	is necessary. First, we describe a hierarchical radiosity algorithm
	that computes conservative lower and upper bounds on the exact radiosity
	function, as well as on the approximate solution. These bounds account
	for the propagation of errors due to interreflections, and provide
	a conservative upper bound on the error. We also describe a non-conservative
	version of the same algorithm that is capable of computing tighter
	bounds, from which more realistic error estimates can be obtained.
	Finally, we derive an expression for the effect of a particular interaction
	on the total error. This yields a new error-driven refinement strategy
	for hierarchical radiosity, which is shown to be superior to brightness-weighted
	refinement.},

  abstract = {The work described here extends the power of $2$D animation with a
	form of texture mapping conveniently controlled by line drawings.
	By tracing points, line segments, spline curves, or filled regions
	on an image, the animator defines features which can be used to animate
	the image. Animations of the control features deform the image smoothly.
	This development is in the tradition of ``skeleton''-based animation,
	and ``feature''-based image metamorphosis. By employing numerics
	developed in the computer vision community for rapid visual surface
	estimation, several important advantages are realized. Skeletons
	are generalized to include curved ``bones,'' the interpolating surface
	is better behaved, the expense of computing the animation is decoupled
	from the number of features in the drawing, and arbitrary holes or
	cuts in the interpolated surface can be accommodated. The same general
	scattered data interpolation technique is applied to the problem
	of mapping animation from one image and set of features to another,
	generalizing the prescriptive power of animated sequences and encouraging
	reuse of animated motion.},

  abstract = {Specifying the motion of an animated linked figure such that it achieves
	given tasks (e.g., throwing a ball into a basket) and performs the
	tasks in a realistic fashion (e.g., gracefully, and following physical
	laws such as gravity) has been an elusive goal for computer animators.
	The {\em spacetime constraints\/} paradigm has been shown to be a
	valuable approach to this problem, but it suffers from computational
	complexity growth as creatures and tasks approach those one would
	like to animate. The complexity is shown to be, in part, due to the
	choice of finite basis with which to represent the trajectories of
	the generalized degrees of freedom. This paper describes new features
	to the spacetime constraints paradigm to address this problem. The
	functions through time of the generalized degrees of freedom are
	reformulated in a hierarchical wavelet representation. This provides
	a means to automatically add detailed motion only where it is required,
	thus minimizing the number of discrete variables. In addition the
	wavelet basis is shown to lead to better conditioned systems of equations
	and thus faster convergence.},

  abstract = {Collaboration is an effective approach to problem solving. Most large-scale
	scientific investigations are highly interdisciplinary and collaborative,
	with project investigators often geographically distributed. For
	example, ITER [1] is a joint international research and development
	project that aims to demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility
	of fusion power. The partners in the project are distributed in more
	than ten countries, and it is imperative that they share their creations
	and findings since greater advances are only made with collective
	efforts. Similarly, I am participating in the U.S. Department of
	Energy's SciDAC (Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing)
	program [2], which sponsors a dozen high-profile science projects.
	Each of the project teams involves researchers from several different
	universities and national laboratories. Clearly, there is an explicit
	need to provide support for collaborative work. How can these researchers
	effectively share their data, problem solving strategies, and research
	findings without time and place constraint? The answer is web-based
	collaboratories, which have been created for many major science projects.
	However, most of these collaboratories are simply data repositories
	with web interfaces. For instance, users do not get to see the associations
	between data and users, which are as valuable as the data itself.
	These associations can be large and very complex, and thus hard to
	comprehend. Visualization can play a key role in both knowledge discovery
	and managing potentially complex and high-dimensional collaborative
	workspace. I have been thinking about how to address the need to
	support collaborative data analysis and visualization, and how to
	direct the visualization research community towards the development
	of such needed technologies. I am going to describe some of the ongoing
	efforts to facilitate sharing visualization resources that will provide
	the eventual support for the kind of collaborative workspace I have
	in mind.},

  abstract = {In the early 1970s, I first encountered Dr. Encarna{\c{c}}{\~a}o at
	the University of Saarbruchen where he was an associate of Professor
	Wolfgang Giloi in the computer graphics department. I met Dr. W.
	Stra\beta er sometime later. At that time, I worked for Information
	Displays Inc. (IDI). Dr. Giloi and Dr. Encarna{\c{c}}{\~a}o were
	interested in acquiring a graphics system for their department and
	after much discussion, they agreed to purchase our unit, the IDIIOM
	(IDI Input Output Machine). See Figure 9.Shortly after we delivered
	the unit to Saarbruchen, Dr. Encarna{\c{c}}{\~a}o told us that he
	had accepted a new position at the University of Daarmstadt, and
	would go there as a full professor to head up their computer graphics
	efforts. We were delighted to learn that he intended to bring the
	IDIIOM with him, Dr. Encarna{\c{c}}{\~a}o and I developed a warm
	personal, as well as professional, relationship and although I left
	IDI in 1976 to form my consultancy, we continued to find ways to
	work together.},

	which ocean waves and islands are rendered by different but related
	algorithms. The algorithms are based on analytic formulas involving
	arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and square roots,
	and are organized for a vectorizing compiler on a Cray 1, a ``supercomputer''
	with a vector pipeline architecture. Height field methods are used,
	one vertical scan line at a time, to trace the direct rays to the
	ocean, where they are reflected. Approximate methods are then applied
	to find whether the reflected rays meet any other objects on their
	way to the sky. The output, at eight bits per pixel, gives information
	for shading, e.g.\ the angle of the surface normal for rays meeting
	the islands, or the angle of elevation from the horizon for rays
	continuing unobstructed to the sky. \\ The output is recorded on
	a magnetic tape for each frame in one cycle of the wave motion, and
	plotted offline on a Dicomed D-48 color film recorder. The eight

	is gradually changed as the wave cycle is repeated to simulate the

  abstract = {Visualization transforms numeric data into a visual form that enables
	users to conceptualize and understand the information. Three-dimensional
	(3D) visualization is the ability to display, analyze, manipulate
	and interact with 3D data in 3 space. New visualization tools, 3D
	in nature, are being designed to display meteorological datasets
	for use in operational forecasting. Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL)
	has been supporting the development of 3D visualization software
	and applications since 1990. Until recently, the emphasis has been
	on research application. Using commercial visualization software
	called the Application Visualization System (AVS5), both analysis
	and forecast 3D data were displayed and investigated. The software
	was used for visual analysis and scanning of data for the presence
	of desired features. For example, plotting of the station observations
	with forecast-generated data allows visual comparison of the two.
	Figure 1 shows 3D images of weather parameters from the Local Analysis
	and Prediction System (LAPS) analysis output, which is created automatically
	on an hourly basis for the World Wide Web. Operational meteorologists
	who issue forecasts and warnings for the nation from the various
	Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs; see http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/wrhq/nwspage.html
	for a display of WFOs across the nation) currently utilize two-dimensional
	displays of analyses and numerical model output, combined with images
	from satellites and radar. They do this on a system developed at
	FSL call the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS).
	Visualization has been used successfully in the research context
	for some time. The next logical step was to determine if 3D visualization
	can offer added value in an operational setting. This required developing
	a 3D visualization workstation application, conducting a forecast
	exercise using the system and evaluating feedback from the exercise.
	An experimental workstation application, Display 3D (D3D), was developed
	at FSL to investigate the complexities and 3D structure of atmospheric
	parameters, and potential value added of 3D displays in an operational
	forecast setting. The D3D system was designed to be used with the
	two-dimensional AWIPS operational system known as D2D.The scope of
	this article covers the development of the D3D application, plus
	a brief description of the D3D real-time exercise (RT98).},

	with a refresh display is used for capturing polygon data from source
	documents. An area boundary network is developed by digitizing nodes,
	pointing to node pairs, and then digitizing edges only once. A CRT
	display monitors, and bell-rings confirm input operations. Facilities
	to erase nodes or edges are available. From the nodes and edges,
	software produces polygons which the user may name or discard. Slivering
	and overlap are eliminated because contiguous polygons have identical

  journal = j-COMP-GRAPHICS,
  year = {2000},
  volume = {34},
  pages = {56--60},
  number = {1},
  month = feb,
  abstract = {In all areas of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), proper treatment
	of the boundary conditions is essential to computing fluid behavior
	correctly. In many engineering problems, CFD is simplified by a priori
	knowledge of the motion of the boundary. The well-known parabolic
	velocity profile in fully-developed flow of an incompressible Newtonian
	fluid in a pipe of circular cross-section is easily computed because
	the boundary (the pipe wall) is known to be in a fixed location.
	Even in more complex settings, such as flow around a ship's propeller,
	the motion of the boundary (the propeller) can be specified in advance.
	
	 By contrast, in most biological fluid dynamics problems the boundaries
	are not rigid and their motions are the result of forces imposed
	on them by the motion of the surrounding fluid. The motion of the
	fluid, of course, cannot be known without knowledge of the boundary
	motion. The motion of the boundary and the motion of the fluid form
	a coupled system; both motions must be computed simultaneously, which
	makes biological CFD difficult.\par
	
	 A particular problem of interest is the flow of blood in the chambers
	of the human heart. The heart is an organ whose muscular contractions
	pump blood around the body. Simplifying somewhat, the heart consists
	of two main pumping chambers that contract simultaneously. One chamber,
	the left ventricle, accepts oxygen-enriched blood from the lungs
	and pumps it to the body. The other chamber, the right ventricle,
	accepts oxygen-depleted blood from the body and pumps it to the lungs.
	The inlet and outlet of each ventricle are guarded by valves whose
	opening and closing guarantee one-directional flow around the circulatory
	system. There are a total of four valves. The valves generally consist
	of two or three leaflets - membranes made of very flexible but inextensible
	material. Familiar examples of materials with this property would
	be paper or fabric which can be easily bent or twisted but which
	are not easily stretched. One edge of each valve leaflet is securely
	attached to the wall of the heart, but the other edge is free of
	attachment and can move with the flow. Structures analogous to a
	valve leaflet are a shirt pocket, with one edge (three sides of a
	rectangular patch pocket) securely stitched to the shirt and one
	edge free of attachment, or a flag, one edge attached to the flag
	pole, the other edge free to wave in the wind. When flow is passing
	through the valve in the forward direction, the valve's leaflets
	are positioned out of the way, permitting flow. When flow attempts
	to pass in the reverse direction, the leaflets come together, their
	free edges pressing against the free edges of their neighbors to
	occlude the flow passage.\par
	
	 The motion of the leaflets is not caused by muscles in the valve.
	The outflow valves are entirely passive structures with no muscular
	tissue whatsoever. Even in the case of the inflow valves, whose free
	edges are connected to the heart muscle by a sparse network of tendons,
	the opening and closing motions result from an interaction with the
	surrounding fluid. The forward motion of the fluid pushes the leaflets
	aside out of the main flow stream, but the inextensibilty of the
	leaflet material prevents free motion of the fluid near the leaflet,
	affecting the entire flow field. Reverse motion of the fluid causes
	the leaflets to move back into the flow passage where contact between
	neighboring leaflets and the inextensibilty of the leaflet material
	halts the flow. The highly interactive nature of the fluid and leaflet
	motions makes this an especially interesting and challenging CFD
	problem.\par
	
	 Commercially available software packages intended for engineering
	CFD are not equipped to handle this type of dynamic interaction between
	boundary and fluid. We have developed a numerical method (the 'Immersed
	Boundary Method') which simultaneously computes the motion of a fluid
	and the motion of an elastic boundary immersed in, and interacting
	with, that fluid. In the Immersed Boundary Method, the fluid is represented
	by Eulerian velocities and pressures that are stored on a regular
	three-dimensional computational lattice. The scale of the heart chambers
	is such that blood can be treated as a Newtonian fluid. Fluid dynamics
	is computed by numerical solution of the Navier--Stokes equations,
	including a body force. The boundary is represented by elastic structures
	that are free to move continuously in the space sampled by the computational
	lattice. The essence of the method is to replace the elastic boundary
	by the forces that result from its deformations. These forces are
	applied to the lattice in the neighborhood of the elastic boundary
	with the aid of a numerical approximation to the Dirac delta function.
	The fluid moves under the action of this body force. The numerical
	delta function is then used again, to interpolate the newly computed
	lattice velocities to the locations of the boundary, and then the
	boundary is moved at the interpolated velocity to a new location
	(the no-slip condition). The process of computing forces, then fluid
	motion and then new boundary location is repeated cyclically in a
	time-stepping procedure with a suitably chosen time step. The only
	requirements for the method are the physical properties of the fluid,
	the (possibly time-dependent) elastic properties of the boundary,
	and the initial geometry of the boundary. A complete description
	of the Immersed Boundary Method can be found in [1, 2].},

	the ``accessibility'' of a surface. These metrics characterize how

	of surface accessibility is extended to include ``global accessibility''
	which measures the ability of a spherical probe to enter a structure
	from outside as well as to fit locally on the surface. The visual
	effect of shading using accessibility is shown to resemble the patina
	on certain tarnished surfaces which have then been cleaned.},

	He suggests using waves as the basis, and discusses the computational
	requirements and new capabilities. illumination by wave fronts, rather
	than light rays \\ A continuing trend in computer representation
	of three dimensional synthetic scenes is the ever more accurate modelling
	of complex illumination effects. Such effects provide cues necessary
	for a convincing illusion of reality. The best current methods simulate
	multiple specular reflections and refractions, but handle at most
	one scattering bounce per light ray. They cannot accurately simulate
	diffuse light sources, nor indirect lighting via scattering media,
	without prohibitive increases in the already very large computing
	costs. \\ Conventional methods depend implicitly on a {\em particle}
	model; light propagates in straight and conceptually infinitely thin
	rays. This paper argues that a {\em wave} model has important computational
	advantages for the complex situations. In this approach, light is
	represented by wave fronts which are stored as two dimensional arrays
	of complex numbers. \\ The propagation of such a front can be simulated
	by a linear transform. Several advantages accrue. Propagations in
	a direction orthogonal to the plane of a front are convolutions which
	can be done by FFT in $O(n \log n)$ time rather than the $n^{2}$
	time for a similar operation using rays. A typical speedup is about
	10,000. The wavelength of the illumination sets a resolution limit
	which prevents unnecessary computation of elements smaller than will
	be visible. The generated wavefronts contain multiplicities of views
	of the scene, which can be individually extracted by passing them
	through different simulated lenses. Lastly the wavefront calculations
	are ideally suited for implementation on available array processors,
	which provide more cost effective calculation for this task than
	general purpose computers. \\ The wave method eliminates the aliasing
	problem; the wavefronts are inherently spatially filtered, but substitutes
	diffraction effects and depth of focus limitations in its stead.},

	in. color television monitor displayed 6 multiplied by 8 km map segments
	(1:50,000 scale) within a 60 multiplied by 80 km map region; participants
	viewed the larger map area by changing the displayed segments. Solution
	time, number of map segments viewed, and quality of route solutions
	were recorded by 24 participants on each of 12 problems divided among
	presentation conditions. Results show that different presentation
	conditions did not significantly affect the quality of routes chosen.
	Problems took the least time when map segments with 50\% overlap

  annote = {info on efficiently ray tracing height fields \\ In standard fractal
	terrain models based on fractional Brownian motion the statistical
	character of the surface is, by design, the same everywhere. A new
	approach to the synthesis of fractal terrain height fields is presented
	which, in contrast to previous techniques, features locally independent
	control of the frequencies composing the surface, and thus local
	control of fractal dimension and other statistical characteristics.
	The new technique, termed {\em noise synthesis}, is intermediate
	in difficulty of implementation, between simple stochastic subdivision
	and Fourier filtering or generalized stochastic subdivision, and
	does not suffer the drawbacks of creases or periodicity. Varying
	the local crossover scale of fractal character or the fractal dimension
	with altitude or other functions yields more realistic first approximations
	to eroded landscapes. A simple physical erosion model is then suggested
	which simulates hydraulic and thermal erosion processes to create
	global stream/valley networks and talus slopes. Finally, an efficient
	ray tracing algorithm for general height fields, of which most fractal
	terrains are a subset, is presented.},

	can be specified by the programmer or a default can be used. The
	default displays provided by Incense present the standard form for
	literals of the basic types, the actual names for scalar types, stacked
	boxes for records and arrays, and curved lines with arrowheads for
	pointers. In addition to displaying data structures, Incense also
	allows the user to select, move, erase and redimension the resulting
	displays. These interactions are provided in a uniform, natural manner
	using a pointing device (mouse) and keyboard.},

  abstract = {A precise shading model is required to display realistic images. Recently
	research on global illumination has been widespread. In global illumination,
	problems of diffuse reflection have been solved fairly well, but
	some optical problems after specular reflection and refraction still
	remain. Some natural phenomena stand out in reflected/refracted light
	from the wave surface of water. Refracted light from water surface
	converges and diverges, and creates shafts of light due to scattered
	light from particles. The color of the water is influenced by scattering/absorption
	effects of water molecules and suspensions. For these effects, the
	intensity and direction of incident light to particles plays an important
	role, and it is difficult to calculate them in conventional ray-tracing
	because light refracts when passing through waves. Therefore, the
	pre-processing tracing from light sources is necessary. The method
	proposed here can effectively calculate optical effects, shaft of
	light, caustics, and color of the water without such pre-processing
	by using a scanline Z-buffer and accumulation buffer.},

	First, a method is presented for efficient slice-by-slice processing

  abstract = {Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics.
	It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity
	and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's
	model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body
	reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent
	of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing
	direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a
	comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from
	rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian
	facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian
	due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model
	accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as
	masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several
	experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces,
	such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surface demonstrate
	significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements
	obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by
	the model.},

  abstract = {Rotated dispersed-dot dither is proposed as a new dither technique
	for digital halftoning. It is based on the discrete one-to-one rotation
	of a Bayer dispersed-dot dither array. Discrete rotation has the
	effect of rotating and splitting a significant part of the frequency
	impulses present in Bayer's halftone arrays into many low-amplitude
	distributed impulses. The halftone patterns produced by the rotated
	dither method therefore incorporate fewer disturbing artifacts than
	the horizontal and vertical components present in most of Bayer's
	halftone patterns. In grayscale wedges produced by rotated dither,
	texture changes at consecutive gray levels are much smoother than
	in error diffusion or in Bayer's dispersed-dot dither methods, thereby
	avoiding contouring effects. Due to its semi-clustering behavior
	at mid-tones, rotated dispersed-dot dither exhibits an improved tone
	reproduction behavior on printers having a significant dot gain,
	while maintaining the high detail rendition capabilities of dispersed-dot
	halftoning algorithms. Besides their use in black and white printing,
	rotated dither halftoning techniques have also been successfully
	applied to in-phase color reproduction on ink-jet printers.},

  abstract = {Welcome to the first edition of our new E-Quarterly. The volunteers
	in ACM SIGGRAPH have been quite busy the past several months and
	I would like to give you a brief progress report on our activities.
	We have put in a large amount of effort on the new website. It is
	based on Plone, which is an Open Source Content management system.
	We plan to offer expanded member services with this system. We have
	formed a new Digital Arts Committee (DAC), Chaired by Masa Inakage.
	They are working on a new SIGGRAPH Arts site to help better support
	the digital artists in our community. This site is currently in beta
	test and should go live within a few weeks. We have passed two new
	policies to enable better support for our small conferences. One
	policy reduces the costs and the other allows for succeeding conferences
	to use some of the profit from previous conferences. We want to significantly
	increase the number of small conferences and especially those that
	are co-located with the annual SIGGRAPH Conference. If you are interested
	in putting on a small conference please contact our Vice-President,
	Alyn Rockwood (rockwood (at) siggraph.org) or the Small Conference
	Coordinator Scott Lang (scott\_lang (at) siggraph.org). This past
	year we have moved the International Resources Program (IRP) and
	Committee from a SIGGRAPH Conference Program to an ACM SIGGRAPH Program.
	This program is under the Vice President who has appointed Kirsten
	Cater as the IRP Chair. One objective of this transition is to engender
	more year round activities. Suggestions can be sent to Alyn or Kirsten
	(kirsten\_cater (at) siggraph.org). Another major effort this year
	has been in strategic planning. We had an expanded meeting in January
	that included the Executive Committee (EC), the Conference Advisory
	Group and several members of the ACM SIGGRAPH Advisory Board. This
	resulted in the formation of three working groups: 1. the structure
	of the annual SIGGRAPH conference, lead by Rob Cook, 2. member programs
	and benefits, lead by Mk Haley, and 3.) the structure of ACM SIGGRAPH,
	lead by Tony Baylis. At the March EC meeting there was more discussion
	and this was followed by much email discussion. Most of the upcoming
	June EC meeting will be devoted to this topic. We plan to have draft
	plans by SIGGRAPH 2006 so we can solicit feedback from our members.
	I welcome any comments or suggestions so please email me at owen
	(at) siggraph.org.},

	quality antialiased images at a modest average sample rate, and to
	refine the image progressively so that the image is available in
	a usable form early and is refined gradually toward the final result.
	\\ The method proceeds by adaptive stochastic sampling of the image
	plane, evaluation of the samples by ray tracing, and image reconstruction
	from the samples. Adaptive control of the sample generation process
	is driven by three basic goals: coverage of the image, location of
	features, and confidence in the values at a distinguished ``pixel
	level'' resolution. \\ A three-stage process of interpolating, filtering,
	and resampling is used to reconstruct a regular grid of display pixels.
	This reconstruction can be either batch or incremental.},

	are both oriented towards raster graphics devices and use the refresher

	always correctly, unless the contour has an ``impossible'' topology
	(e. g. similar to the letter O), and even then does not produce any
	leaks outside the external part of the contour. The other algorithm
	does the filling correctly only if the contour has no triple points,
	e. e. pixels which are common to three arcs. The first algorithm
	can be implemented in practice only within the microprocessor controlling
	the display, while the second can be implemented easily in the host
	computer and use the refresher memory only for storage. Some of the
	simpler (and obvious) algorithms are discussed for comparison. The
	proposed algorithms do not use decomposition into simpler polygons.
	They can easily be adapted for shading according to any preassigned
	rule.},

	for a low cost pattern digitizer. A basic graphics package was written
	which renders both text and vectors on the storage terminal. Around
	this core, and application program was organized which permits an
	operator to log piercing point coordinate data from a scaled drawing.
	Output is then committed to paper tape for permanent storage and
	PROM for control of the sewing machine. Additional features allow
	for graphical editing of patterns, display of stored pattern ``programs''
	from PROM or paper tape, and merging of new and\slash or old patterns.},

	by allowing displacements to be defined along curved trajectories
	of flow fields. The main contribution of this generalized technique,
	which will be referred to as {\em flow mapping\/}, is an alternative
	model of offset surfaces that extends the class of shapes that can
	be modelled using displacement maps. The paper also discusses methods
	for synthesizing homogeneous displacement textures. Finally, it introduces
	the concept of a {\em texture atlas\/} for efficient sampling and

  annote = {volume-related texturing via a ``ray marching'' algorithm \\ We model
	phenomena intermediate between shape and texture by using space-filling
	applicative functions to modulate density. The model is essentially
	an extension of procedural solid texture synthesis, but evaluated
	throughout a volumetric region instead of only at surfaces. \\ We
	have been able to obtain visually realistic representations of such
	shape+texture ({\em hypertexture}) phenomena as hair, fur, fire,
	glass, fluid flow and erosion effects. We show how this is done,
	first by describing a set of base level functions to provide basic
	texture and control capabilities, then by combining these to synthesize
	various phenomena. \\ Hypertexture exists within an intermediate
	region between object and non-object. We introduce a notion of {\em
	generalized boolean shape operators} to combine shapes having such
	a region. \\ Rendering is accomplished by {\em ray marching} from
	the eye point through the volume to accumulate opacity along each
	ray. We have implemented our hypertexture rendering algorithms on
	a traditional serial computer, a distributed network of computers
	and a coarse-grain MIMD computer. Extensions to the rendering technique
	incorporating refraction and reflection effects are discussed.},

	Yet from a critical artistic perspective, the question remains: why
	do performances so generated frequently read as lifeless or 'zombie-like'?
	While improvement in the density of collection and integration of
	data will undoubtedly refine the quality of the motion capture product,
	the anatomical answer to this artistic question goes beyond refinement
	of quasistatic simulation schemes and finite elements methods to
	address several basic principles of human facial anatomy, expression
	and ontogeny (development from juvenile to adult). The latter consideration
	is especially important in issues involving inter-individual scaling,
	because translation of facial performance onto characters of differing
	proportions presents one of the greatest challenges to the utility
	of motion capture.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality systems are placing never before seen demands on computer
	graphics hardware, yet few graphics systems are designed specifically
	for virtural reality. An address recalculation pipeline is a graphics
	display controller specifically designed for use with head mounted
	virtual reality systems, it performs orientation viewport mapping
	after rendering which means the users head orientation does not need
	to be known accurately until less than a microsecond before the first
	pixel of an update frame is actually sent to the head mounted display
	device. As a result the user perceived latency to head rotations
	is minimal. Using such a controller with image composition it is
	possible to render different objects within the world at different
	rate, thus it is possible to concentrate the available rendering
	power on the sections of the scene that change the most. The concentration
	of rendering power is known as priority rendering. Reductions of
	one order of magnitude in the number of objects rendered for an entire
	scene have been observed when using priority rendering. When non
	interactive background scenes which are rendered with a high quality
	rendering algorithm such as ray tracing are added to the world, highly
	realistic virtual worlds are possible with little or no latency.},

	Agency's (U.S. EPA) Scientific Visualization Center, we are exploring
	the combination of 3D visual displays with emerging information technologies.
	The following discussion highlights prototype efforts in three arenas:
	(1) Integrating Visualization into Data Mining Techniques; (2) Exploring
	Policy Analysis Visualization and (3) Combining Object-Relational
	Databases, Visualization and Web Technologies. The three prototypes
	are still in embryotic form. We anticipate it will take three to
	five years for actualization of these concepts and precise implementation
	details will change over time. The U.S. EPA is currently designing
	and implementing a new high profile Office of Environmental Information
	that will advocate the use and management of information as a strategic
	resource to enhance public health and environmental protection. New
	information technologies will be applied to facilitate the collection
	and dissemination of environmental data. We are hopeful that interactive
	visualization tools will be successfully used across the entire range
	of users, computing platforms and World Wide Web (Web) technologies
	that support the information life cycle.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the design and implementation of IRIS Performer,
	a toolkit for visual simulation, virtual reality, and other real-time
	$3$D graphics applications. The principal design goal is to allow
	application developers to more easily obtain maximal performance
	from $3$D graphics workstations which feature multiple CPUs and support
	an immediate-mode rendering library. To this end, the toolkit combines
	a low-level library for high-performance rendering with a high-level
	library that implements pipelined, parallel traversals of a hierarchical
	scene graph. While discussing the toolkit architecture, the paper
	illuminates and addresses performance issues fundamental to immediate-mode
	graphics and coarse-grained, pipelined multiprocessing. Graphics
	optimizations focus on efficient data transfer to the graphics subsystem,
	reduction of mode settings, and restricting state inheritance. The
	toolkit's multiprocessing features solve the problems of how to partition
	work among multiple processes, how to synchronize these processes,
	and how to manage data in a pipelined, multiprocessing environment.
	The paper also discusses support for intersection detection, fixed-frame
	rates, run-time profiling and special effects such as geometric morphing.},

  annote = {hierarchical bounding boxes, used to speed up ray tracing and other
	algorithms \\ Hierarchical representations of 3-dimensional objects
	are both time and space efficient. They typically consist of trees
	whose branches represent bounding volumes and whose terminal nodes
	represent primitive object elements (usually polygons). This paper
	describes a method whereby the object space is represented entirely
	by a hierarchical data structure consisting of bounding volumes,
	with no other form of representation. This homogeneity allows the
	visible surface rendering to be performed simply and efficiently.
	\\ The bounding volumes selected for this algorithm are parallelepipeds
	oriented to minimize their sizes. With this representation, any surface
	can be rendered since in the limit the bounding volumes make up a
	point representation of the object. The advantage is that the visibility
	calculations consist only of a search through the data structure
	to determine the correspondence between terminal level bounding volumes
	and the current pixel. For ray tracing algorithms, this means that
	a simplified operation will produce the point of intersection of
	each ray with the bounding volumes. \\ Memory requirements are minimized
	by expanding or fetching lower levels of the hierarchy only when
	required. Because the viewing process has a single operation and
	primitive type, the software and hardware chosen to implement the
	search can be highly optimized for very fast execution.},

  abstract = {Monte Carlo techniques for image synthesis are simple and powerful,
	but they are prone to noise from inadequate sampling. This paper
	describes a class of non-linear filters that remove sampling noise
	in synthetic images without removing salient features. This is achieved
	by spreading real input sample values into the output image via variable-width
	filter kernels, rather than gathering samples into each output pixel
	via a constant-width kernel. The technique is nonlinear because kernel
	widths are based on sample magnitudes, and this local redistribution
	of values cannot generally be mapped to a linear function. Nevertheless,
	the technique preserves energy because the kernels are normalized,
	and all input samples have the same average influence on the output.
	To demonstrate its effectiveness, the new filtering method is applied
	to two rendering techniques. The first is a Monte Carlo path tracing
	technique with the conflicting goals of keeping pixel variance below
	a specified limit and finishing in a finite amount of time; this
	application shows how the filter may be used to ``clean up'' areas
	where it is not practical to sample adequately. The second is a hybrid
	deterministic and Monte Carlo ray-tracing program; this application
	shows how the filter can be effective even when the pixel variance
	is not known.},

  abstract = {We present an interactive system for creating pen-and-ink illustrations.
	The system uses {\em stroke textures\/}---collections of strokes
	arranged in different patterns---to generate texture and tone. The
	user ``paints'' with a desired stroke texture to achieve a desired
	tone, and the computer draws all of the individual strokes. The system
	includes support for using scanned or rendered images for reference
	to provide the user with guides for outline and tone. By following
	these guides closely, the illustration system can be used for interactive
	digital halftoning, in which stroke textures are applied to convey
	details that would otherwise be lost in this black-and-white medium.
	By removing the burden of placing individual strokes from the user,
	the illustration system makes it possible to create fine stroke work
	with a purely mouse-based interface. Thus, this approach holds promise
	for bringing high-quality black-and-white illustration to the world
	of personal computing and desktop publishing.},

	display controller is a typical Z-80 microprocessor system interfaced
	to the 4014 by a standard Tektronix parallel interface. A portion
	of the Z-80 memory is used as the display buffer, allowing it to
	be divided into store and non-store (refreshed) segments. The microprocessor
	performs the conversion from the simple integer X,Y coordinates in
	the display buffer to actual Tektronix drawing commands. A second
	Z-80 microprocessor is used to perform graphical transformations
	and transfer the data from the PDP-11 host to the Z-80 display controller.
	The operations performed by the second microprocessor include translation,
	rotation and scaling.},

	Steiner patches are triangular surface patches for which the Cartesian
	coordinates of points on the patch are defined parametrically by
	quadratic polynomial functions of two variables. It has recently
	been shown that it is possible to express a Steiner patch in an implicit
	equation which is a degree four polynomial in $x, y, z$. Furthermore,the
	parameters of a point known to be on the surface can be computed
	as rational polynomial functions of $x, y, z$. These findings lead
	to a straightforward algorithm for ray tracing Steiner patches in
	which the ray intersection equation is a degree four polynomial in
	the parameter of the ray. The algorithm presented represents a major
	simplification over existing techniques for ray tracing free-form
	surface patches.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality is a new and rapidly developing technology. As a technological
	extension to computer graphics, and in fact the computer in general,
	VR is a medium --- a means of communication. Like any medium, the
	use or `reading' of VR has to be learned. That is, the user becomes
	literate with the medium. Often, we tend to think of literacy in
	terms of whether one can read or write words on a page. However,
	that is just literacy of one medium (the written word). There are
	many forms of communication, and each has specific issues of literacy,
	as well as general issues that pervade all media. As a new medium,
	the `language' of VR is still in its infancy, therefore, the study
	of VR literacy must look both at the content receiver and the content
	creator. Like film, Virtual Reality is a medium that does not require
	much knowledge of the viewer beyond general life experiences. We
	are able to see and hear the content more or less as we do in day
	to day living. Because of this, it might be taken for granted that
	the viewer is literate in the medium. This is not necessarily so.
	He or she may be able to follow the action, but may be missing the
	underlying message and cues contained in the content. Much like learning
	to read and write, gaining literacy in this new medium requires effort
	on the part of the receiver. This paper will address those issues
	with which VR participants and developers must be concerned.},

	such as engineering (CAD, CAE and CAM), geographic information systems

	and graphics and image techniques are combined together in some special
	applications. Computer graphics can no longer be regarded as a confined
	discipline devoted solely to graphics standards or traditional techniques
	of 3D representations and rendering. The influence of computer graphics
	and its related techniques can be felt in almost all of today's key
	industrial areas, wherever computers are employed. Computer graphics
	has been a subject of interest in China for many years. Primary overviews
	of computer graphics activities in China were presented in [9] (on
	research and industry) and [8] (on education). In addition, there
	was also a special journal issue on computer graphics in China [10].
	However, computer graphics activities in Hong Kong [7] and Macao
	were not included in these materials. Furthermore some new achievements
	were achieved in the past years. For example, in the State Key Lab
	of CAD\&CG, Zhejiang University, a four-sided CAVE was installed
	in 1999. In addition, nowadays virtual reality (VR) is a hot research
	topic. In China researchers have attained many achievements in various
	VR fields. We will emphasize this aspect as we introduce computer
	graphics activities in China. This article gives an overview of the
	research and development of computer graphics in China, including
	the mainland of China, Hong Kong and Macao. The article is organized
	as follows. The next section introduces computer graphics research
	in some major universities and institutes in China. The section following

	faster image synthesis with more physical fidelity. The paraxial
	approximation theory for efficiently tracing a pencil of rays is
	described and analysis of its errors is conducted to insure the accuracy
	required for pencil tracing. The paraxial approximation is formulated
	from a 4x4 matrix (a system matrix) that provides the basis for pencil
	tracing and a variety of ray tracing techniques, such as beam tracing,
	ray tracing with cones, ray-object intersection tolerance, and a
	lighting model for reflection and refraction. In the error analysis,
	functions that estimate approximation errors and determine a constraint
	on the spread angle of a pencil are given. \\ The theory results
	in the following fast ray tracing algorithms; ray tracing using a
	system matrix, ray interpolation, and extended `beam tracing' using
	a `generalized perspective transform.' Some experiments are described
	to show their advantages. A lighting model is also developed to calculate

	It is based on the calculation of {\em extended form-factors}, which

	calculations. This method is particularly well suited to the extended

	The morphologies of creatures and the neural systems for controlling

	algorithms. Different fitness evaluation functions are used to direct
	simulated evolutions towards specific behaviors such as swimming,
	walking, jumping, and following. A genetic language is presented
	that uses nodes and connections as its primitive elements to represent
	directed graphs, which are used to describe both the morphology and
	the neural circuitry of these creatures. This genetic language defines
	a hyperspace containing an indefinite number of possible creatures
	with behaviors, and when it is searched using optimization techniques,
	a variety of successful and interesting locomotion strategies emerge,
	some of which would be difficult to invent or built by design.},

  abstract = {We present an approach for accelerating hierarchical radiosity by
	clustering objects. Previous approaches constructed effective hierarchies
	by subdividing surfaces, but could not exploit a hierarchical grouping
	on existing surfaces. This limitation resulted in an excessive number
	of initial links in complex environments. Initial linking is potentially
	the most expensive portion of hierarchical radiosity algorithms,
	and constrains the complexity of the environments that can be simulated.
	The clustering algorithm presented here operates by estimating energy
	transfer between collections of objects while maintaining reliable
	error bounds on each transfer. Two methods of bounding the transfers
	are employed with different tradeoffs between accuracy and time.
	In contrast with the {\em O\/}({\em s\/}2) time and space complexity
	of the initial linking in previous hierarchical radiosity algorithms,
	the new methods have complexities of {\em O\/}({\em s\/}log{\em s\/})
	and {\em O\/}({\em s\/}) for both time and space. Using these methods
	we have obtained speedups of two orders of magnitude for environments
	of moderate complexity while maintaining comparable accuracy.},

	In earlier work the visible scene components were calculated and

	cartoons. That work was limited to visible planar surface elements
	because of the display algorithms employed. Display time is limited
	to 33 ms so that scan-interlaced TV may be used. Curved surfaces
	would normally be approximated by a large number of facets; however,
	Mach effect's faceting of the surface will occur for all but the
	simplest cases. Point by point curved surface shading is examined
	in detail so that special hardware may be defined for displaying
	the visible surface parts in 33 ms. The hardware concepts employed
	can be extended to other simple curvatures that appear repeatedly
	in a visible scene.},

	data describing the acoustical behavior of performance halls, but
	typically the analytical results are difficult to assimilate and

	data, substantially greater amounts of information than that conveyed
	by standard techniques can be communicated to the designer. This
	allows designs of different acoustical spaces to be tested, evaluated,
	and compared. \\ An example comparing the acoustical behavior of
	three different concert halls demonstrates these techniques and allows
	for the simultaneous assimilation of much of the information necessary
	to evaluate the acoustical nature of a space. The use of three-dimensional
	images, color, animation and abstract representation allows for the
	comprehension of the complex results of a scientific simulation.
	Specifically, the simultaneous display of particular icons familiar
	to the discipline enabled the simultaneous presentation of up to
	twelve parameters. \\ From a more general point of view, the procedures
	demonstrate how computer graphics can be utilized for the portrayal
	of multi-dimensional time dependent data. The visualization techniques
	are potentially useful for the display of three-dimensional vector
	fields in many scientific and design applications.},

	regions such that the structure or ``aspect'' of the visible area
	of the light source is constant within each region. The paper also
	describes a fast, practical algorithm to compute the structure of
	the visible light source in each region. Both algorithms exploit
	spatial coherence and are the most efficient yet developed. Given
	the structure of the visible light source in a region, queries of
	the form ``What specific areas of the light source are visible?''
	can be answered almost instantly from any point in the region. This
	speeds up by several orders of magnitude the accurate computation
	of first level diffuse reflections due to an area light source. Furthermore,
	the shadow boundaries form a good initial decomposition of the scene
	for global illumination computations.},

	the generation of successive ray traced images when the geometry
	of the scene remains constant and only the light source intensities
	and the surface properties need to be adjusted. When the scene is
	first traced, an expression parameterized in the color of all lights
	and the surface property coefficients of all objects is calculated
	and stored for each pixel. Redisplaying a scene with a new set of
	lights and colors then consists of substituting values for the corresponding
	parameters and re-evaluating the expressions for the pixels. This
	parameter updating and redisplay takes only a few seconds, as compared
	to the many minutes or hours required to ray trace the entire scene
	again, but it uses much more memory and disk space. With suitable
	expression sharing, however, these storage needs can be reduced to
	an acceptable level.},

  abstract = {We describe a system that computes radiosity solutions for polygonal
	environments much larger than can be stored in main memory. The solution
	is stored in and retrieved from a database as the computation proceeds.
	Our system is based on two ideas: the use of visibility oracles to
	find source and blocker surfaces potentially visible to a receiving
	surface; and the use of hierarchical techniques to represent interactions
	between large surfaces efficiently, and to represent the computed
	radiosity solution compactly. Visibility information allows the environment
	to be {\em partitioned\/} into subsets, each containing all the information
	necessary to transfer light to a cluster of receiving polygons. Since
	the largest subset needed for any particular cluster is much smaller
	than the total size of the environment, these subset computations
	can be performed in much less memory than can classical or hierarchical
	radiosity. The computation is then {\em ordered\/} for further efficiency.
	Careful ordering of energy transfers minimizes the number of database
	reads and writes. We report results from large solutions of unfurnished
	and furnished buildings, and show that our implementation's observed
	running time scales nearly linearly with both local and global model
	complexity.},

	is many more than can be rendered at interactive frame rates. However,
	due to occlusion by opaque surfaces (e.g. walls), only a small fraction
	of a typical model is visible from most viewpoints. \\ We describe
	a method of visibility preprocessing that is efficient and effective
	for axis-aligned or axial architectural models. A model is subdivided
	into rectangular cells whose boundaries coincide with major opaque
	surfaces. Non-opaque portals identified on cell boundaries, and used
	to form an adjacency graph connecting the cells of the subdivision.
	Next, the cell-to-cell visibility is computed for each cell of the
	subdivision, by linking pairs of cells between which unobstructed
	sightlines exist. \\ During an interactive walkthrough phase, an
	observer with a known position and view cone moves through the model.
	At each frame, the cell containing the observer is identified, and
	the contents of potentially visible cells are retrieved from storage.
	The set of potentially visible cells is further reduced by culling
	it against the observer's view cone, producing the eye-to-cell visibility.
	The contents of the remaining visible cells are then sent to a graphics
	pipeline for hidden-surface removal and rendering. \\ Tests on moderately
	complex 2-D and 3-D axial models reveal substantially reduced rendering
	loads.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a framework for animation that can achieve the
	intricacy of motion evident in certain natural ecosystems with minimal
	input from the animator. The realistic appearance, movement, and
	behavior of individual animals, as well as the patterns of behavior
	evident in groups of animals fall within the scope of the framework.
	Our approach to emulating this level of natural complexity is to
	model each animal holistically as an autonomous agent situated in
	its physical world. To demonstrate the approach, we develop a physics-based,
	virtual marine world. The world is inhabited by artificial fishes
	that can swim hydrodynamically in simulated water through the motor
	control of internal muscles that motivates fins. Their repertoire
	of behaviors relies on their perception of the dynamic environment.
	As in nature, the detailed motions of artificial fishes in their
	virtual habitat are not entirely predictable because they are not
	scripted.},

  abstract = {Range imaging offers an inexpensive and accurate means for digitizing
	the shape of three-dimensional objects. Because most objects self
	occlude, no single range image suffices to describe the entire object.
	We present a method for combining a collection of range images into
	a single polygonal mesh that completely describes an object to the
	extent that it is visible from the outside. The steps in our method
	are: (1) align the meshes with each other using a modified iterated
	closest-point algorithm, (2) zipper together adjacent meshes to form
	a continuous surface that correctly captures the topology of the
	object, and (3) compute local weighted averages of surface positions
	on all meshes to form a consensus surface geometry. Our system differs
	from previous approaches in that it is incremental; scans are acquired
	and combined one at a time. This approach allows us to acquire and
	combine large numbers of scans with minimal storage overhead. Our
	largest models contain up to 360,000 triangles. All the steps needed
	to digitize an object that requires up to 10 range scans can be performed
	using our system with five minutes of user interaction and a few
	hours of compute time. We show two models created using our method
	with range data from a commercial rangefinder that employs laser
	stripe technology.},

	statements either in batch or in keyboard-interactive mode and produces
	line drawings of objects on CRT's and plotting devices. A variety
	of drawing styles is available: dimensioned orthographics, perspectives,

	of the PADL-1.0/2 system include (1) general combinational operators
	that may be applied to any part defined in PADL, (2) correct handling
	of ``pathologies'' that occur when (for example) two objects have
	partially coincident boundaries, (3) maintenance of consistent multiple
	representations of the same object, and (4) automatic posting on
	drawings of dimensions to reflect user-defined geometric relations
	between features of objects. An overview is presented of both the
	language and the current processor's capabilities and organization.},

	However, sampling problems inherent in the hemi-cube algorithm limit
	its usefulness for complex images. A more robust approach is described
	in which ray tracing is used to perform the numerical integration

	and scan conversion hardware present in many graphics workstations
	to rapidly approximate the optical flow in a scene. The optical flow

	values are averaged over surfaces and used in place of a constant
	``ambient'' term. Illuminance calculations are made only for those

	the calculation is adjusted to maintain a constant accuracy, permitting
	less populated portions of the scene to be computed quickly. Successive
	reflections use proportionally fewer samples, which speeds the process
	and provides a natural limit to recursion. The technique can also
	diffuse transmission and illumination from large area sources, such

	this context a variety of first generation effects, including shadowing

	from the treatment of caustics within classical optics are included

	scenes is described. The hardware system is relatively low cost,
	and operates on several hundred vectors in real-time. The system
	consists of a graphics peripheral connected to a PDP 11\slash 55
	computer and a software package to drive the peripheral. As each
	convex object is displayed, the occlusion hardware extracts the silhouette
	and retains it in a one-plane ``matte memory''. As subsequent objects,
	taken from a priority ordered list, are displayed, the vector generator
	tests the contents of the frame buffer at the coordinates along the
	vector. The contents of the matte memory determine which portions
	of the vector should be intensified. To produce the priority ordered
	list of objects, the software algorithm uses three ordering techniques
	applied selectively to different portions of the scene. One technique,
	used for ordering unconstrained pairs of objects is described in
	detail.},

	controllable free-form surfaces of arbitrary topology. Surfaces may
	be pinned down at points and along curves, cut up and smoothly welded

	control is formulated as a constrained shape optimization, with minimization
	of squared principal curvatures yielding graceful shapes that are
	free of the parameterization worries accompanying many patch-based
	approaches. Triangulated point sets are used to approximate these
	smooth variational surfaces, bridging the gap between patch-based
	and particle-based representations. Automatic refinement, mesh smoothing,
	and re-triangulation maintain a good computational mesh as the surface
	shape evolves, and give sample points and surface features much of
	the freedom to slide around in the surface that oriented particles
	enjoy. The resulting surface triangulations are constructed and maintained
	in real time.},

	The more one delves into their mysteries it becomes clear how inter-disciplinary
	they are. The mind jumps from one impression to the next in determining
	how existence is constructed. Though the perception may be subjective,
	it is an experience that is shared by many.\par
	
	 Science, the arts and technology are three separate disciplines,
	but have more in common than meets the eye. They are different lenses
	from which to observe reality.\par
	
	 We may see things differently, but if we share our insights, we build
	bridges and broaden our understanding.\par
	
	 This is the theme for the May 2009 issue of the SIGGRAPH e-quarter
	'Computer Graphics', emphasizing the importance of collaboration
	to improve the way computer graphics is used in different ways.\par
	
	 Elizabeth A. Rega, Department of Anatomy, Western University of Heath
	Sciences and Stuart S. Sumida, Department of Biology, California
	State University of Heath Sciences, have written an article together
	entitled 'Anatomical Considerations in Facial Motion Capture', stressing
	the importance of understanding inherent traits of human facial expression
	to improve motion capture performance.\par
	
	 'iVisit Agitating for the Evolution of Fixed-mobile Tele-presence

	smart phone and pocket PC devices to assist doctors in meeting and
	treating patients remotely and helping persons who are visually impaired.\par

	most popular BRDF representations introduced so far and analyzed
	the most recent trends in this area. This article follows up an earlier
	article entitle 'Representing BRDFs using SOMs and MANs', also written
	by Murat Kurt together with Muhammed G{\'o}khan Cinsdikici, Ege University,
	International Computer Institute, Turkey.\par
	
	 Contributor Carlos D. Correa has written an informative article entitled
	'Visualizing What Lies Inside' for VisFiles, a very interesting read.
	My thanks to Kwan-Liu Ma for his continued solicitation of meaningful
	content for this section of the newsletter.\par
	
	 In conclusion, Jack Lew, Director of Collaborations at the Center
	for Emerging Media, University of Central Florida, comes full circle
	through his submission to Education entitled 'Connecting the Dots
	by Crossing Borders', sharing how he, in his new position, sees scientists,
	artists and technologists collaborating and exploring new solutions
	in this field we broadly identify as computer graphics. Jack also
	contributed with the organizational chart used in the design of this
	issue's cover illustration.},

  abstract = {Despite busy schedules, our many members find the time to in some
	way get involved with SIGGRAPH activities, most typically the annual
	conference. Blocking out a full week to attend is for most a willing
	sacrifice to further professional development, catch up with friends
	and colleagues, review new innovations or to view fascinating art
	and great films, all related to the nuances of what computer graphics
	has to offer. In the deeper folds of the membership, others volunteer
	to help develop and organize the resources ACM/SIGGRAPH provides
	to the full community. One of those is this newsletter, 'Computer
	Graphics', which I am sure the majority of its readers considers
	as their membership 'magazine', published four times a year. The
	article, 'Making It Real: The Future of Stereoscopic 3D Film Technology'
	from Sony Pictures Imageworks, written by Eden Ashley Umble, was
	initiated by Sande Scoredos, Executive Director of Technical Training
	\& Artist Development. Carlye Archibeque, Senior Coordinator of Marketing
	\& Communications was instrumental in pulling all the pieces and
	people together and getting it approved by the Imageworks legal department
	for publication. I mention this only because most will not be aware
	of how much goes into putting together a seemingly straightforward
	article about behind the scenes operations at a movie studio. Douglas
	Easterly's excerpt from his most recent book on Macromedia Flash
	development is a wonderful read on how multimedia artist Ricardo
	Miranda Z{\'u}{\~n}iga uses the technology to create his Internet
	based art and social commentaries. As you flip through the pages
	of this first issue, you find that there are still sections under
	the Table of Contents that still need to be addressed. This is where
	the greater ACM/SIGGRAPH community comes in. Unlike a magazine you
	would purchase at the market, this one is driven by its members and
	sent directly to their homes, now in digital form. We are still getting
	used to the new format and I know that as time goes by, many will
	start to understand the ease of contributing and the newsletter will
	grow. So I urge each and everyone reading these pages to think of
	how your quarterly can best serve your needs. Let your voice be heard
	by sharing articles and information that will interest our community
	at large. I welcome to hear from each and every one that wants to
	get involved. If you are interested in participating actively in
	preparing and publishing 'Computer Graphics', we have a few volunteer
	positions that we are looking to fill.},

  abstract = {The SIGGRAPH conference is a truly educational experience, and so
	it is again this week in Boston. Though my first time here, I love
	Boston. I love my hotel room overlooking the harbor, I love the water
	taxi that took me from Logan International Airport to the Boston
	World Trade Center and I love the family of educators, researchers,
	artists and vendors that collect for this yearly event celebrating
	the digital collaboration between art and science. Reflecting more
	closely, computer graphics is dependent on this collaboration as
	are the players that see computer graphics as both a part of their
	lives as well as a part of their identities. The longer one is involved
	in this community, the more clearly it is apparent how interdependent
	the different tribes are. Commercial studios need the technology
	as well as the talent to produce the quality and competitive products
	their customers expect. Vendors providing the solutions are dependent
	on the end users that both implement and promote the technology,
	just as schools need a reason to provide both the research and education
	that will support their for-profit brothers and sisters. More than
	ever, education has become the resource from which the other groups
	can draw. I refer to education in the institutional sense, which
	provides an organized forum for students, teachers and researchers
	to contribute to the whole in support of the computer graphics industry.
	The feature articles for this issue submitted by authors affiliated
	with three Pittsburgh educational centers would reflect just that,
	each one of them finding their own way in the field of computer graphics.
	University of Pittsburgh intern Matt Duncan with the help of Matthew
	Kelley and Jeffrey Jacobson has written about his experience learning
	the Unreal Editor as it relates to further development of Virtual
	Reality technologies. Eric Sloss has organized an article about the
	research that Ben Fry, the newly appointed Nierenberg Chair of Design
	at Carnegie Mellon University, intends to do in his new position.
	Students Thomas Netzband and Patrick Bannan from The Art Institute
	of Pittsburgh write about their experience in producing a 3D animated
	short as a group project during production classes.},

	are standing amidst the cast in an environment so vivid it seems

	image chosen for this first online issue of 'Computer Graphics' is
	a still from Robert Zemeckis' film 'The Polar Express', also produced
	for IMAX 3D by Sony Imageworks. It is imaginable that in the not
	too distant future, the technology behind Stereoscopics and developments
	such as Real-D will bring cinema much closer to its audience, diminishing
	the difference between the movie house experience and a live, stage
	performance. Eden Ashley Umble has written an excellent article about

	be applied to all environments, in fact, for which visible surfaces
	can be computed. This comprehensive algorithm, which permits curved
	shadows to be cast on curved surfaces, is contrasted with a less
	costly method for casting the shadows of the environment on a single

	Stroke textures also allow resolution-dependent rendering, in which
	the choice of strokes used in an illustration is appropriately tied

	implicit surfaces. A simple constraint locks a set of particles onto
	a surface while the particles and the surface move. We use the constraint
	to make surfaces follow particles, and to make particles follow surfaces.
	We implement {\em control points\/} for direct manipulation by specifying
	particle motions, then solving for surface motion that maintains
	the constraint. For sampling and rendering, we run the constraint
	in the order direction, creating {\em floater\/} particles that roam
	freely over the surface. Local repulsion is used to make floaters
	spread evenly across the surface. By varying the radius of repulsion
	adaptively, and fissioning or killing particles based on the local
	density, we can achieve good sampling distributions very rapidly,
	and maintain them even in the face of rapid and extreme deformations
	and changes in surface topology.},

	a large number of existing base maps. One way of replacing the error-prone
	and very time-consuming manual digitization by an automatic method
	is scanning the map and extracting the linework from the resulting
	binary matrix. A sufficiently fast and economic scan-to-line-conversion
	algorithm has to be developed for the line extraction. The algorithm
	presented operates with a skeletonization technique which is further
	developed from known line thinning methods, so that the scan lines
	are now skeletonized in a single pass and that only a small number
	of scan lines has to be held in core storage. The result of this
	process is equivalent to a multi-pass skeletonization which utilizes
	a quasi-parallel line thinning in four partitions of the binary matrix
	for each pass. The data produced by the extraction algorithms following
	the skeletonization have two important advantages over data produced
	by manual digitization: First, the nodes corresponding to the line
	end points are exactly determined and, second, the correction phase
	is shortened since the automatic process is less error-prone.},

  abstract = {This article describes the development and implementation of a data
	compression algorithm designed specifically for fingerprints, referred
	to as GBP compression. The algorithm is herein discussed. Data Compression
	algorithms can be designed for general applications, meaning the
	input data is unknown. This is more commonly referred to as generic
	data. [LI01] Or, data compression algorithms can be designed for
	specific applications. E.g. AFIS [Automated Fingerprint Identification
	Systems] 'When the input is known, higher compression ratios can
	be achieved with the knowledge of the input data stream.' To-date,
	the highest compression ratio for an unknown input data stream, for
	all data compression algorithms, is JPEG with an average compression
	ratio range of 1:17 --- 1:23. [PEN03] The algorithm herein discussed,
	has a compression ratio range of 1:68 --- 1:92. There is a value,
	time and place for each design method --- generic or specific ---
	depending upon a variety of factors. Due to the nature of the use
	of AFIS for law enforcement and incrimination as well as criminal
	conviction, there are social issues that make data integrity of paramount
	concern. This factor influences algorithm selection and design. A
	lossless algorithm is a must! Also, the nature of AFIS is such that
	it operates across borders and between states, municipalities and
	jurisdictions. In addition to the usual issues and resistance to
	accepting new technology, including software [e.g. resistance to
	change, fear of system failure, etc.], there are the issues of changing
	engineering standards [hardware and software] which are governmentally
	determined as well as governmental policy decisions. Likewise, the
	portability required in implementing a new algorithm, will have to
	deal with a variety of hardware and software; as well as be designed
	to integrate into existing systems. This integration must include
	the ability to incorporate existing JPEG data files, from existing
	police databases. This requires a handshaking of standards and conversion
	programs that maintain data integrity. In addition, there is an in
	depth discussion of the limits of compression with a novel perspective.},
